The results are mention in body of the research and underlined in the conclusions of the work.\n\n\n3rd point:\nThe output of the research is highlighted in the short summaries of the paper (abstract, conclusions, or discussions). The authors of the work presented the data in structured digestible form.\n\n\n4th point:\nThe findings demonstrated with charts or tables, and there is a link to the manuscripts, research data, or additional supplimentary materials. However, the original data is not accessable, or in order to access the data, other researchers need to make a request, fully andertend the architecture of the storage platform, where the data was reserved.\n\n\n5th point:\nThe results are presented in a table and the collected data during the research is fully available and easally accessable for the replication of the results by other investigators. The data in the presented tables is consistant with the values presented in the text and the raw data of the research."
