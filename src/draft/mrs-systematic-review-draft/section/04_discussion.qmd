### Who Did Get All the Brains?

The United States of America lieding in the number of publications and the number of implemented solutions. The US shows desire and finantial and technical cababilities to progress in the more efficient healthcare management. It is hard to compare a quality of the proposed solutions due to diversity of approaches but tomorrow's statistics will show the results of the efficiency of the menegement systems implemented today. The second by quantity of the produces research in the medical scheduling is China. There have been found no research from numerous of countries. The majority of these countries have small- or midle-size economies. Since the implementation requires money to build infrastructure for effective medical recording system and on top of that the advance healthcare management is possible. However, money is just a half of the recepie: the efficient implementations of innovations from the operations research requires high-level of profficiency from caregivers and hospital administration staff.


### Quality of Research

The results yiel a high percentage of misconduct and unresponsible research practicies. The reviewed papers are for the most part quantitative analysis of the produced scheduling or analysing approaches. Therefore, the outputs are models and comparisons to the existed prior solutions. Newertheless, part of the publications do not state the objectives of the research, do not present comparative analysis, and some even forgot to evaluate own models. Additionaly, hardships on getting medical records published for the open-access makes it impossible to replicate the published study to prove its valuability oe highlight mistakes. The absents of the key components of the research shows need in training of qualified scientists.




## Limitations of Evidence

There is critical situation with prooving the performance results and achievements of the developed scheduling solutions, since most of the papers do not give access to the research data to be able to reproduce the gained results. The reasons for the studies with implementation of the solutions in real hospitals are known and related to policies and regulations regarding sharing sensitive medical information publically. To the publications which use artificial datasets for tests and evaluation the responsibility for pure research practice is on the researchers. The lack of the replicable studies is one of the main reasons for exponantial growth of the publications but inability to build robast and applicable scheduling models. 




## Limitations of Review Processes

This study covers only five most known databases in medicine, computer science, and general research. There are numerous less known datasets from academic and commersial domains which are not included into the survey. Furthermore, the software solutions which is already offers services to hospitals may cover some or even all the functionality discussed in the research, but nothing even remotly similar was found duren the analysis of the business articles on the medical innovations. Therefore this matter requires separate dedicated investigation with in depth communication with the users and the developers of the softwere solutions. 

The publications between 2020 and 2023 got the most attention. By trasting the earlier literature reviews and systematically analysing the resent works the core tandency of the medical resource scheduling was outline in this systematic review. There is still a small possibility of the valuable work in the set of unread articles and even not popular poblucations have valuable aspects in them. Therefore, the scoped literature represent general idea of the situation, but by no meens it is the full picture of the current situation in the industry. 




## Implications

### Sharing the Knowledge

As it was seen from the results even though the number of the published papers grown drastically for the last three years, the precental of the studies which offer reproducebility of the research even worthen. Here could be multiple resons for such behaviour. First, the practical medical resource scheduling requires access to some medical recorts to make proper validation of the proposed solution. A medical record is sensitive data. To be able to share it, the data should be properly anonymised and the research on the data should be approved by data provider and local laws regarding data review, collection, and sharing. Getting all ligal documents consums a lot of time and effords. Lieading, for most cases, to not bothering with reproducibility of the research in the first place. Second probable reason for lack of reproducible research is deliberate or unvoluntary neglaction of this aspect of the research conduct by the authrors. Finnaly, lack of knowledge to create a reproducible study.

There is a viable set of actions to address the problem with medical records. The data administrators in hospitals or researchers, who already has access to medical records, can preprocess the data to "unlink" the personal data from the datasets and preserve the optimsal structure for further development of the research. Since most of the hospitals even in the same country has different policies and regulations regarding the volume of the data and the recording process, the more different datasets will become available in open-source, the easier it will be to create new robust, optimsal scheduling solutions 

For the second and the third resons of not conducting proper research, the best approach is to increase awareness of the research teams in their institutions by providing sufficient training. Probably, increase appealing learning resources in the pablic area such as social media, television, etc. Particularly, regarding the researchers who deliberetly misconduct their works, the consiquences of such behaviour can be discussed in public media.


### No optimal solutions
What is meant by not optimal solutions? There are either generalisable but not applicable studies or vise-versa. The main reason for this is discussed in the previous subsection, but enother issue is in nerrow foucus on the scheduling problem of one specific resource. The operating theatre planning and scheduling is integrated problem as well as nurse rostering and patient appointment allocation. These problems are interconnected and by ignoring this fact the designed automated soltions become unscalable or unapplicable. Ensuring thet the scheduling system can propose a sufficient solutiont withouth bank of medical records and enhance the scheduling slowely and steadally as the more and more medical records become available to the system is the approach which will produce reproducible, generalised results for multiple departments and hospitals worldwide. 

The raise of the machine learning in health industry brought critical questions regarding desicions made by machines. There are to sides to these concerns: responsibility of the developers of the schedulig system and responsobility by healthcare proffesionals who use the software. As it is right now, the best approach is to consider any automated desicion-macking tools as advisors not a final instance for the choice. In this way the machine learning systems will guide proffesionals to reach better healthcare performance and reduce risk and concequences of a mistake for interns.
