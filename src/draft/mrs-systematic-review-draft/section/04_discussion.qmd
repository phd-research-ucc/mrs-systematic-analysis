### Sharing the Knowledge

As it was seen from the results even though the number of the published papers grown drastically for the last three years, the precental of the studies which offer reproducebility of the research even worthen. Here could be multiple resons for such behaviour. First, the practical medical resource scheduling requires access to some medical recorts to make proper validation of the proposed solution. A medical record is sensitive data. To be able to share it, the data should be properly anonymised and the research on the data should be approved by data provider and local laws regarding data review, collection, and sharing. Getting all ligal documents consums a lot of time and effords. Lieading, for most cases, to not bothering with reproducibility of the research in the first place. Second probable reason for lack of reproducible research is deliberate or unvoluntary neglaction of this aspect of the research conduct by the authrors. Finnaly, lack of knowledge to create a reproducible study.

There is a viable set of actions to address the problem with medical records. The data administrators in hospitals or researchers, who already has access to medical records, can preprocess the data to "unlink" the personal data from the datasets and preserve the optimsal structure for further development of the research. Since most of the hospitals even in the same country has different policies and regulations regarding the volume of the data and the recording process, the more different datasets will become available in open-source, the easier it will be to create new robust, optimsal scheduling solutions 

For the second and the third resons of not conducting proper research, the best approach is to increase awareness of the research teams in their institutions by providing sufficient training. Probably, increase appealing learning resources in the pablic area such as social media, television, etc. Particularly, regarding the researchers who deliberetly misconduct their works, the consiquences of such behaviour can be discussed in public media.


### No optimal solutions
What is meant by not optimal solutions? There are either generalisable but not applicable studies or vise-versa. The main reason for this is discussed in the previous subsection, but enother issue is in nerrow foucus on the scheduling problem of one specific resource. The operating theatre planning and scheduling is integrated problem as well as nurse rostering and patient appointment allocation. These problems are interconnected and by ignoring this fact the designed automated soltions become unscalable or unapplicable. Ensuring thet the scheduling system can propose a sufficient solutiont withouth bank of medical records and enhance the scheduling slowely and steadally as the more and more medical records become available to the system is the approach which will produce reproducible, generalised results for multiple departments and hospitals worldwide. 

The raise of the machine learning in health industry brought critical questions regarding desicions made by machines. There are to sides to these concerns: responsibility of the developers of the schedulig system and responsobility by healthcare proffesionals who use the software. As it is right now, the best approach is to consider any automated desicion-macking tools as advisors not a final instance for the choice. In this way the machine learning systems will guide proffesionals to reach better healthcare performance and reduce risk and concequences of a mistake for interns.
