    "text": "3.5 Results of Syntheses\nIn this section the outcomes of the analysis syntheses on the papers combined into three subgroups that present data-driven, process-driven, and hybrid solutions to the medical resource scheduling problem. The meta-analysis demonstrates the advantages and disadvanatages of the approaches in scope of robustness, applocability, and the complexoty of the models.\n\n3.5.1 Characteristics of Contributing Studies\nThere are three main charactersitics of the research studies which are analysed in this review. The first is robustness of the medical resource scheduler. The second represents the applicability of the proposed solutions in real hospitals. The final characteristic shows the complexity of the model based on the problem formulation in each case. Secondary features such as level of integration and decision-making of the models and location of the researchers and the implemented solutions were also extracted from the reviewed works.\n\n\n3.5.2 Results of Statistical Syntheses\nThe subsection demonstrates results in seven investigated aspects: robusntess, applicability, complexity, integtry of the solutions, also what levels of desicion-making are the most often researched for the last three years, what countries have the most scientific potential in scope of human resources, and finally the most progressive countries in terms of researching for needs of a specific hospitals. All this aspects have their own subgroups of data-driven and process-driven approaches, and some topycs are overlapping to showcase discribution of the study in the medical resource scheduling.\n\n3.5.2.1 Data on Robustness\nFor multiple reasons the parameter of robustness is much higher for the theoretical stadies then in practical applicable solutions. The first reason is that the number of data-driven, in particular deep learning, approaches is drastically increased for the last years. The focus on historical data is beneficial for applicability of the result, but in cost of robustness of the model, which makes it harder to apply the same model for multiple solutions but with slitelly different environment and input data. Second lab models are more idealised, and thus more inclusive than complex realistic models. And finally, most of the hospitals in the studies work almost independantly for other healthcare facilities especially with facilities in other countries. This strategy gains quick local benefits but also reduces generasability of the hospital protocols for other developing hospitals.\nTHE PLOT SHOWCASES ROBUSTNESS FOR STUDIES ON DATA-DRIVEN, PROCESS-DRIVEN, AND HYBRIT APPROACHES FOR THE AT-LEAST LAST THREE YEARS\n\n\n3.5.2.2 Data on Applicability\nThe applicability score is driven from actual model implementation in the real hospitals. If the model works on the sentatic data generated from the real medical records, it gains plus one point of applicability, if the model works on the real data - plus two points, if the model is implemented in real environment it has three points, if the model works in real time it is four points, and finally if the model is integrated with the general healthcare record system it is five-point of applicability to this solution. Clearly data-driven solutions ar in the lead of applicability for the last three years, doe to increased interest to deep learning models for healthcare applications.\nTHE PLOT SHOWCASES APPLICABILITY FOR STUDIES ON DATA-DRIVEN, PROCESS-DRIVEN, AND HYBRIT APPROACHES FOR THE AT-LEAST LAST THREE YEARS\n\n\n3.5.2.3 Data on Complexity\nThe complexity and the applicability of the medical resource scheduling problem are clossely related. Especially when there is no way to compare the developing process and the design solution amoung themselves. Nevertheless each additional constraint in the model specification introduces additional complexity.\nTHE PLOT SHOWCASES COMPLEXITY FOR STUDIES ON DATA-DRIVEN, PROCESS-DRIVEN, AND HYBRIT APPROACHES FOR THE AT-LEAST LAST THREE YEARS\n\n\n3.5.2.4 Data on Integrated Solutions\nThe results on level of integrations are simmilar to the complexity characteristic of the reviewed studies. Nevertheless, complex scheduling is not always highly-integrated. The problem deffinition can be consentraited specifically on-to operating theatre and consider all possible timing charateristics of the scheduling problems but not take into account upstream and downstream capacities. Therefore, complexity relates to depth and width of the problem components when integrity highlights only the width of the scheduling problem.\nTHE PLOT SHOWCASES COMPLEXITY FOR STUDIES ON DATA-DRIVEN, PROCESS-DRIVEN, AND HYBRIT APPROACHES FOR THE AT-LEAST LAST THREE YEARS\n\n\n3.5.2.5 Data on Level of Decision-Making\nThe plots of three reviewed charactersitics in relation to decision-making levels show the distribution of approaches amoung the strategical, tactical, and operational levels of decision. The studies where the decision level was not identified are not included in this analysis.\nTHE PLOT OF ROBUSTNESS, APPLICABILITY, AND COMPLEXITY OF SOLUTIONS FOR EACH DECISION-MAKING LEVEL\n\n\n3.5.2.6 The Human-Scientific Potential\nThe plots below show the scientific-human potential based on the number of affiliations for operational research in healthcare. The duplicates of affiliations have been removed before the analysis. The most reserchers in the area of medical resource scheduling are consentraited in United States, China, and Iran.\nTHE PLOT IS A GLOBAL MAP WHICH SHOWS THE COUNTRIES WITH THE RESEARCHERS ON THE FIELD OF MEDICAL RESOURCE SCHEDULING\n\n\n3.5.2.7 Localisation of the Studies\nThis analysis is similar to the previous chart, but this shows locations where the studies are actually implemented. This time the Netherlands are showing much higher rate of implementation of the scietific results then China and Iran, and climebs onto the second position by the number of implemented studies in real healthcare facilities.\nTHE PLOT SHOWS A GLOBAL MAP WITH COUNTRIES WITH THE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES WHICH PARTISIPATED IN MEDICAL RESOURCE SCHEDULING RESEARCHES\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Results of Investigation of Heterogeneity\nFor the study of this scope the identification of the studies which can be effectively compared and analysed on bias within the sertain borders is not a trivial task. First of all, even the medical resource scheduling problem goes under umbrella of one term, there are numerouse problems which this term contains. And even, for example, if the operating theatre scheduling is considered as a focal point of the research, the problem formulationions for that segment of scheduling problems varies greatly. Therefore, to unify measuring criteria for the reviewed, it was desided to compare the studies based on the three metrices: robustness, applicability, and complexity.\nPRESENT THE GENERAL RESULTS WITH HETEROGENEITY TABLE FOR DATA-DRIVEN, PROCESS-DRIVEN, AND HYBRID SOLUTIONS\n\n3.5.3.1 Robustness:\nThe data-driven methods show better robustness then other approaches. The wide data used in the data-driven algorithm increases the focus of the modules to a specific environments. This make machine learning approaches less scalable for different scenarios in the same area of schedulig medical resources. If consider some general advisory system which will serve a veriaty of hospitals there is a requirements for protocols of processes to which the system will resert when there is no hystoric data available.\nPRESENT FOREST TREES OF WORKS REGARDIGN ROBUSTNESS FOR EACH SUBGROUP BASED ON PROBLEM DEFFINITION\n\n\n3.5.3.2 Applicability:\nThe major consern is that most of the work consentraited on the non-applicable solutions. Hopefully the interest in deep learning solutions tip this scale in the favor of more applicability of the scheduling models. It is easy to see that data-driven and hybrid models are producing much more practical solutions then process driven approaches. The advantage of deep learning algorithms is in finding solutions depending directrly on the historic data without a layer of abstraction, which often oversimplifies the problems.\nPRESENT FOREST TREES OF WORKS REGARDIGN APPLICABILITY FOR EACH SUBGROUP BASED ON PROBLEM DEFFINITION\n\n\n3.5.3.3 Complexity:\nOnly small portion of the research are considered complex with at least 0.8 of above score. One of the highly possible reasons for this is that even the authors who eventually build solutions for complex models start with the smaller simpler tasks to test their theory and understand the diractions of improvement. The mean value suggest that the researchers are still mostrly intrested in simple and midium-complexity models.\nPRESENT FOREST TREES OF WORKS REGARDIGN COMPLEXITY FOR EACH SUBGROUP BASED ON PROBLEM DEFFINITION\n\n\n\n3.5.4 Results of Sensitivity Analyses\nThe sensetivity analysis is condacted focusing on the quality and count of studies, and also on robustness, applicability, and complexity of the solutions. For the leveraging parameters the country income, population, and results of the PISO2014 international survey are taken into account. Also the model is available by the LINK which predicts the research state in the area of advanced computational methods for medical resource scheduling based on the input values underlined in the previous sentance. According to the results, the next trends can be seen below:\nPRESENT TWO VARIENTIONS OF PLOTS: (I) X AXES REPRESENTS INCOME, Y AXES REPRESENTS ONE OF 4 ASPECTS: QUALITY OF RESEARCH, ROBUSTNESS, APPLICABILITY, AND COMPLEXITY OF THE SOLUTIONS, SIZE OF THE BOOBLE REPRESENTS THE POPULATION SIZE; (II) X AXES SOME GENERAL PARAMETER FORM PISO2014, THE REST IS THE SAME AS IN THE PREVIOUS TYPE (I) PLOTS\nThe lack of information on published papers due to artificial limitation to only English emplies that the presented analysis is not full but still representative. The forest plots presented below show veriaty in the results.\nTHE RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSES VISUALLY USING FOREST PLOTS\nThe outcomes of the sensitivity analysis are also generalised by analysing their heterogeneity.\nALSO CONSIDER SHOWING HETEROGENEITY PLOTS OR TABLES GENERALISING RESULTS FRON FOREST PLOTS"

    "section": "4.1 Interpretation",
    "text": "4.1 Interpretation\n\n4.1.1 Stategy Decision Levels\nThe understanding of the decision levels important to understand what computational solutions will bring the most benefits on what decision level. The higher the level of desicion-making the more distant it is to actual human interaction and more matter of structuring numbers and deriving reasonable solutions from there. The lover levels, on the other hand, requires more human-like response and bieng present “in the field” to make optimal decisions for the moment. Nevertheless, the understanding of the personnel actions from the strategic level is critical to produce realistic policies, regulations, and strutegies for the caregivers in-action.\nFrom the analysis of the available literature, it seams that the more computational approaches consentraited on the lower tactical and operational levels, where the efficient desicions from a computational system requires high efforts in ensuring the accurat, relevant, complete, and timely data. For higher tactical and stratagic levels there is more “room” for data to stay accurat, releven, and timely. Hense, it is high possibilities that if these scientific effords will be focused on the higher levels of decision-making, the value of these studies will drastically increase.\n\n\n4.1.2 Integration of the Scheduling Problem\nThe nature of research requires to ignore some variables regarding the investigated phenomena, but the medical resource scheduling is an NP-hard problem with numerous critaria. There is no study which will clearly define prorities of the different parts of medical resource scheduling. The reason for this, is that the scheduling problems in hospitals differ by funding, level of staff profissiancy, policies and regulations, and available data for analysis. The first issue which is need to be addressed is the medical records. Without medical records there is not idea where the hospital administration is trying to improve and what is realy important. But even here different hospitals may persuit different paths depending on what metrics should be measured: revenue, utilisation time, patient waiting time or patient and staff satisfaction… ???\nThe literature proposes for the most cases narrow approach to the scheduling problem. With the growth of the constrains the problem becomes more complex to find sufficient solutions and therefore the number of publications plummets down. It is not a rational to try to put as many as possible constraints in the scheduling models. Therefore, it is need to develop an approach of definning the most valuable aspects of the problem to the liest valuable. Desiding what parameters are more valuable than the other can be multi-objective task itself. For example, the hospital administration may consider gains form the improving sertain critaria, required resources to measure the critaria, complexity of the analysation of the measured data, what other critarias may be influance by increase of the chosen parameter, and finaly needed components to improve the certain parameters of the healthcare services in this hospital. Because this is an over-complicated task for itself, most of the hospitals either go with the simplest critatia to track and work with whatever data theu will gain in the process, or copy the paths of hospitals with the well established criterias. Both of the choises are valid practical approaches.\n\n\n4.1.3 Upstream and Downstream Capacities\nThe management of capacities related to the operating theatres is crucial to avoid blocking the opearing theatre even though the surgery is over, but new case cannot be allowed in the theatre by numerouse possible reasons. Here the computational systems can be usefull in keeping track of available beds, nurses, and anaesthegiologists in preoperative and postoperative units. It involves the suffisticated records system which allow to undertand occupancy of the available resources. Without it a planning of the operation cases and other healthcare services is “going blind in a maze”, but with the habits of recording the state of the upstream and downstream capacities the computational approaches can bring analysis of the demands and therefore propose strategies for planning of the needed capacities. However, the on-the-fly desicions cannot be supported by the automated advisory systems. The best method dealing with the critical unavailability of the resources is to have policies of prioritisations of these resources prepared beforehand. To ensure that the policies are working the medical stuff should be trained to follow the policies in critical situations. ???\n\n\n4.1.4 Types of Patients\nThere is significant inbalance in research dedicated to elective and non-elective patients. The non-elective patients are not considered for the most cases. The reason for this that most authors asumen that the hospitals would have dedicated capacity for emergent cases, which is not always the case. The dedicated emergency theatre is capacity which is consumes a lot of resources to maintain and for the most time stands idel. That makes the separate non-elective patients care suboptimal in terms of efficient medical resource utilisation. This itself raises the importance of the research for non-elective surgery cases to the same level as the elective cases if not makes even more crusial to investigate. The managing of emergent cases is a challenge for medical resource scheduling system for its unpredictability. Newertheless, with sufficient datasets of medical records it will be or even is possible to predict using modern machine learning techniques.\nThe studies which focuse on emergent cases there is clear understanding that there are veriaty of protocols regarding how to identify urgency level of the surgery and what actions should be made. Difference in hospitals’ policies and regulations is the main reason why there is still no unified, correct approach of managing non-elective cases. The evailability of hospital records as well as generalisation protocols will drastically increase the efficiency in how hospitals administration prepares and allocates emergency cases.\nShifting to the classification of the patients by hospitalisation. The inpatients and outpatiens for the most studies are treated the same. However, the ambulatory and surgery outpatients are differ from the inpatients because they can just not come to the appointed event. In the literature these aspect is studied separatly for general surgery scheduling and for most of the cases is resulved by prediction models and overbooking the resources required for the event (consultation, ambulatory analysis, and surgery) for the events with high risk of no-show. From the perspective of the hospitals there is also possibility of cancellations with reasons unrelated to a particular appointment event. With this in mind, the study which will consider the uncertainty of cancellation of the events while focusing on the medical resource planning and allocation would bring additional insights on the possible improvement in the healthcare management.\n\n\n4.1.5 Who Got All the Brains?\nThe United States of America lieding in the number of publications and the number of implemented solutions. The US shows desire and finantial and technical cababilities to progress in the more efficient healthcare management. It is hard to compare a quality of the proposed solutions due to diversity of approaches but tomorrow’s statistics will show the results of the efficiency of the menegement systems implemented today. The second by quantity of the produces research in the medical scheduling is China. There have been found no research from numerous of countries. The majority of these countries have small- or midle-size economies. Since the implementation requires money to build infrastructure for effective medical recording system and on top of that the advance healthcare management is possible. However, money is just a half of the recepie: the efficient implementations of innovations from the operations research requires high-level of profficiency from caregivers and hospital administration staff.\n\n\n4.1.6 Quality of Research\nThe results yiel a high percentage of misconduct and unresponsible research practicies. The reviewed papers are for the most part quantitative analysis of the produced scheduling or analysing approaches. Therefore, the outputs are models and comparisons to the existed prior solutions. Newertheless, part of the publications do not state the objectives of the research, do not present comparative analysis, and some even forgot to evaluate own models. Additionaly, hardships on getting medical records published for the open-access makes it impossible to replicate the published study to prove its valuability oe highlight mistakes. The absents of the key components of the research shows need in training of qualified scientists."

To the publications which use artificial datasets for tests and evaluation the responsibility for pure research practice is on the researchers.

There are numerous less known datasets from academic and commersial domains which are not included into the survey. Furthermore, the software solutions which is already offers services to hospitals may cover some or even all the functionality discussed in the research, but nothing even remotly similar was found duren the analysis of the business articles on the medical innovations. Therefore this matter requires separate dedicated investigation with in depth communication with the users and the developers of the softwere solutions.\nThe publications between 2020 and 2023 got the most attention. By trasting the earlier literature reviews and systematically analysing the resent works the core tandency of the medical resource scheduling was outline in this systematic review. There is still a small possibility of the valuable work in the set of unread articles and even not popular poblucations have valuable aspects in them. Therefore, the scoped literature represent general idea of the situation, but by no meens it is the full picture of the current situation in the industry.\nWith focus on operating theatre scheduling in mind, the elements of healthcare which has little to no influance to the patient flow in surgery departments have been filtered out on the scanning process. This excludes research in areas of drag supply chain optimisation, ambulance decision making, home healthcare, ambulatory results analysis, and prescription analysis.\nThe scanning, reviewving, and analysis of the studies was done by one person which indicated high chance of biased conclusions. In order to minimise the one-side view on the reviews works the summaries and the notes of reviewing author together with the estimation of the level of comprehension are available for review and comments.

    "text": "4.4 Implications\n\n4.4.1 Sharing the Knowledge\nAs it was seen from the results even though the number of the published papers grown drastically for the last three years, the precental of the studies which offer reproducebility of the research even worthen. Here could be multiple resons for such behaviour. First, the practical medical resource scheduling requires access to some medical recorts to make proper validation of the proposed solution. A medical record is sensitive data. To be able to share it, the data should be properly anonymised and the research on the data should be approved by data provider and local laws regarding data review, collection, and sharing. Getting all ligal documents consums a lot of time and effords. Lieading, for most cases, to not bothering with reproducibility of the research in the first place. Second probable reason for lack of reproducible research is deliberate or unvoluntary neglaction of this aspect of the research conduct by the authrors. Finnaly, lack of knowledge to create a reproducible study.\nThere is a viable set of actions to address the problem with medical records. The data administrators in hospitals or researchers, who already has access to medical records, can preprocess the data to “unlink” the personal data from the datasets and preserve the optimsal structure for further development of the research. Since most of the hospitals even in the same country has different policies and regulations regarding the volume of the data and the recording process, the more different datasets will become available in open-source, the easier it will be to create new robust, optimsal scheduling solutions\nFor the second and the third resons of not conducting proper research, the best approach is to increase awareness of the research teams in their institutions by providing sufficient training. Probably, increase appealing learning resources in the pablic area such as social media, television, etc. Particularly, regarding the researchers who deliberetly misconduct their works, the consiquences of such behaviour can be discussed in public media.\n\n\n4.4.2 No ultimate solutions\nWhat is meant by not optimal solutions? There are either generalisable but not applicable studies or vise-versa. The main reason for this is discussed in the previous subsection, but enother issue is in nerrow foucus on the scheduling problem of one specific resource. The operating theatre planning and scheduling is integrated problem as well as nurse rostering and patient appointment allocation. These problems are interconnected and by ignoring this fact the designed automated soltions become unscalable or unapplicable. Ensuring thet the scheduling system can propose a sufficient solutiont withouth bank of medical records and enhance the scheduling slowely and steadally as the more and more medical records become available to the system is the approach which will produce reproducible, generalised results for multiple departments and hospitals worldwide.\nThe raise of the machine learning in health industry brought critical questions regarding desicions made by machines. There are to sides to these concerns: responsibility of the developers of the schedulig system and responsobility by healthcare proffesionals who use the software. As it is right now, the best approach is to consider any automated desicion-macking tools as advisors not a final instance for the choice. In this way the machine learning systems will guide proffesionals to reach better healthcare performance and reduce risk and concequences of a mistake for interns."

It is only natural that automated computational methods will get more attention than classical approaches to medical resource scheduling. Furthermore, the Science Foundation Ireland Centre for Research Training in Artificial Intelligence requires progress in advanced computational methods, which narrows the interest even more in the direction of machine learning, neural networks, and meta-heuristics. The authors who represent the medical area of the research are either former workers of the Transformation Theatre Team in Ireland or closely related to this initiative.
