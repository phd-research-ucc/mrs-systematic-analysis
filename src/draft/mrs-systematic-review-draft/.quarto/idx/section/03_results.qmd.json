First of all, even the medical resource scheduling problem goes under umbrella of one term, there are numerouse problems which this term contains. And even, for example, if the operating theatre scheduling is considered as a focal point of the research, the problem formulationions for that segment of scheduling problems varies greatly. Therefore, to unify measuring criteria for the reviewed, it was desided to compare the studies based on the three metrices: robustness, applicability, and complexity. \n\n\n\n\n### Results of Sensitivity Analyses\n\n<div style=\"color: teal;\">\n\nIf any sensitivity analyses were conducted:\n\n- report the results for each sensitivity analysis.\n\n- comment on how robust the main analysis was given the results of all corresponding sensitivity analyses.\n\n- consider presenting results in tables that indicate: (i) the summary effect estimate, a measure of precision (and potentially other relevant statistics, for example, I2 statistic) and contributing studies for the original meta-analysis; (ii) the same information for the sensitivity analysis; and (iii) details of the original and sensitivity analysis assumptions.\n\n- consider presenting results of sensitivity analyses visually using forest plots.\n\n</div>\n\n\n## Reporting Biases\n\nThere are high interest in the machine learning trends specially in deep learning, which clearly makes the research community favor these approaches over the other existing methods for medical resource scheduling. To investigate the existing biases when commes to synthesysing the advance computational system to support desicions of the healthcare managers the availability and the type of the outcomes of the studies are considered.\n\nThe percentyle of the possitive findings is much higher in research with deep learning approaches then in all other approchers. These results \n\n<div style=\"color: teal;\">\n\nPresent assessments of risk of bias due to missing results (arising from reporting biases) for each synthesis assessed.\n\nIf a tool was used to assess risk of bias due to missing results in a synthesis, present responses to questions in the tool, judgements about risk of bias and any information used to support such judgements.\n\nIf a funnel plot was generated to evaluate small-study effects (one cause of which is reporting biases), present the plot and specify the effect estimate and measure of precision used in the plot. If a contour-enhanced funnel plot was generated, specify the ‘milestones’ of statistical significance that the plotted contour lines represent (P = 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, etc.)\n\nIf a test for funnel plot asymmetry was used, report the exact P value observed for the test, and potentially other relevant statistics, for example the standardised normal deviate, from which the P value is derived.\n\nIf any sensitivity analyses seeking to explore the potential impact of missing results on the synthesis were conducted, present results of each analysis (see item #20d), compare them with results of the primary analysis, and report results with due consideration of the limitations of the statistical method.\n\nIf studies were assessed for selective non-reporting of results by comparing outcomes and analyses pre-specified in study registers, protocols, and statistical analysis plans with results that were available in study reports, consider presenting a matrix (with rows as studies and columns as syntheses) to present the availability of study results.\n\nIf an assessment of selective non-reporting of results reveals that some studies are missing from the synthesis, consider displaying the studies with missing results underneath a forest plot or including a table with the available study results.\n</div>\n\n\n\n## Certainty of Evidence\n\nThe certainty of the evidence in the reviewed studies are rated with five-scale grade. Where are five critarias of certainty, each of the reached criteria gains a point of certainty to the reviewed material. The grading systems is created in the way that for most of the cases the next point of certainty can be gained if the requirements for the previous points are meat:\n\n- 1st point: The resutls of the research are mentioned in the body of the report paper with explanation how the results were obtained.\n\n- 2nd point: The process of reaching the findings of the study is clearly stated. The results are mention in body of the research and underlined in the conclusions of the work. \n\n- 3rd point: The output of the research is highlighted in the short summaries of the paper (abstract, conclusions, or discussions). The authors of the work presented the data in structured digestible form.\n\n- 4th point: The findings demonstrated with charts or tables, and there is a link to the manuscripts, research data, or additional supplimentary materials. However, the original data is not accessable, or in order to access the data, other researchers need to make a request, fully andertend the architecture of the storage platform, where the data was reserved.  \n\n- 5th point: The results are presented in a table and the collected data during the research is fully available and easally accessable for the replication of the results by other investigators. The data in the presented tables is consistant with the values presented in the text and the raw data of the research.\n\nPROVIDE A TABLE OR/AND CHART WITH CERTAINTY GRADES FOR THE REVIEWED WORKS\n\nThe average certainty of the results is belove medium possible level on the certainty scale. The main reason for this is complications to get medical records available as open-source database. However, if researchers gave more attention to the reproducibility of the research, this score would be much higher even with the existing challenges in the healthcare industry.\n\nPROVIDE A DETAILED
