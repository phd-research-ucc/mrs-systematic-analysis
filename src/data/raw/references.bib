	abstract = {In this research, we studied operating room scheduling problem of assigning a set of surgeries to several multifunctional operating rooms. The objectives are to maximize the utilization of the operating rooms, to minimize the overtime-operating cost, and to minimize the wasting cost for the unused time. To begin with, a revised mathematical model is constructed to assign surgeries to operating rooms within one week. Then, we proposed four easy-to-implement heuristics that can guarantee to find feasible solutions for the studied problem efficiently. Furthermore, we presented four local search procedures that can improve a given solution significantly. Finally, a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) that incorporated with initial solutions, local search procedures and elite search procedure is applied to the studied problem. Computational results show that for small problem instances, the HGA can find near optimal solutions efficiently while for large problem instances, the HGA performs significantly better than the four proposed heuristics. We concluded that surgery schedules obtained by using HGA has less wasting cost for the unused time, much higher utilization of operating rooms, and produce less overtime-operating cost.},

@article{012CALBBDandB&C2021,
	abstract = {We study a generalized operating room planning and scheduling (GORPS) problem at the Toronto General Hospital (TGH) in Ontario, Canada. GORPS allocates elective patients and resources (i.e., operating rooms, surgeons, anesthetists) to days, assigns resources to patients, and sequences patients in each day. We consider patients' due-date, resource eligibility, heterogeneous performances of resources, downstream unit requirements, and lag times between resources. The goal is to create a weekly surgery schedule that minimizes fixed- and over-time costs. We model GORPS using mixed-integer and constraint programming models. To efficiently and effectively solve these models, we develop new` multi-featured logic-based Benders decomposition approaches. Using data from TGH, we demonstrate that our best algorithm solves GORPS with an average optimality gap of 2.71\% which allows us to provide our practical recommendations. First, we can increase daily OR utilization to reach 80\%---25\% higher than the status quo in TGH. Second, we do not require to optimize for the daily selection of anesthetists---this finding allows for the development of effective dominance rules that significantly mitigate intractability. Third, solving GORPS without downstream capacities (like many papers in literature) makes GORPS easier to solve, but such OR schedules are only feasible in 24\% of instances. Finally, with existing ORs' safety capacities, TGH can manage 40\% increase in its surgical volumes. We provide recommendations on how TGH must adjust its downstream capacities for varying levels of surgical volume increases (e.g., current urgent need for more capacity due to the current Covid-19 pandemic).},

@article{013IDOptMathModel2021,
	abstract = {Department of Surgery (DOS) contributes to a major portion of hospitals expenditures and revenues. The costs come from resources which are involved in a surgery. These resources must be used optimally through proper scheduling. Recently, there are still many hospitals schedule the operating rooms manually which will take relatively longer time. Whereas the scheduling of the operating room can be done through developing a mathematical model. We consider several aspects in the model of this research, including the number of operating rooms, working hours, the available number of anesthetic machines, and utilization of each room. We propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to solve the operating room scheduling problem and based on the model, a decision support system (DSS) is developed to allow the hospital generates a better schedule with a shorter time. The results of sensitivity shows that the model is sensitive to the changes of surgery duration and the available number of anesthetic machines.},

	abstract = {Background: Operating rooms are the core of hospitals. They are a primary source of revenue and are often seen as one of the bottlenecks in the medical system. Many efforts are made to increase throughput, reduce costs, and maximize incomes, as well as optimize clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. We trained a predictive model on the length of surgeries to improve the productivity and utility of operative rooms in general hospitals. Methods: We collected clinical and administrative data for the last 10 years from two large general public hospitals in Israel. We trained a machine learning model to give the expected length of surgery using pre-operative data. These data included diagnoses, laboratory tests, risk factors, demographics, procedures, anesthesia type, and the main surgeon&rsquo;s level of experience. We compared our model to a na&iuml;ve model that represented current practice. Findings: Our prediction model achieved better performance than the na&iuml;ve model and explained almost 70% of the variance in surgery durations. Interpretation: A machine learning-based model can be a useful approach for increasing operating room utilization. Among the most important factors were the type of procedures and the main surgeon&rsquo;s level of experience. The model enables the harmonizing of hospital productivity through wise scheduling and matching suitable teams for a variety of clinical procedures for the benefit of the individual patient and the system as a whole.},

@article{015IRMetaheuristicFuzzy2022,
	abstract = {Today, planning and scheduling problems are the most significant issues in the world and make a great impact on improving organizational productivity and serving systems such as medical and healthcare providers. Since operating room planning is a major problem in healthcare organizations, the optimization of medical staff and equipment plays an essential role. Thus, this study presents a multi-objective mathematical model with a new categorization (preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative) to minimize operating room scheduling and the risk of using equipment. Time constraints in healthcare systems and medical equipment limited capacity are the most significant considered limitation in the present study. In this regard, since the duration of patient preparation and implementation of treatment processes occur in three states of optimistic, pessimistic, and normal, the introduced parameters are examined relying on a fuzzy uncertainty analysis of the problem. Hence, the model is measured in a real numerical solution sample in a medical center to evaluate and confirm the proposed mathematical model. Then, two meta-heuristic algorithms (NRGA and NSGAII) are implemented on the mathematical model to analyze the proposed model. Finally, the research results indicate that the NSGA-II is more efficient in the operating room scheduling problem.},

@article{031INOTUAudit2000,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The operation theatre complex of a hospital represents an area of considerable expenditure in a hospital budget and requires maximal utilization to ensure optimum cost-benefit. There is paucity of data in India on the use of available operating time and the reasons for less-than-optimal utilization have not been studied. METHODS: This audit was done prospectively over a period of 12 months in the department of general surgery, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Pondicherry. Operation theatre utilization was studied with respect to the starting and closing of the operation theatre, interval between surgical procedures, cancellation of surgical procedures and reasons thereof. RESULTS: The operation theatre was functional for 279 days during the year of the study, and 1773 cases were operated (6.3 cases per day). The total operating time utilized was 91.5%. The major reasons for cancellation of a total of 310 cases were lack of operating time (65.2%), emergency surgery during the elective list (13.9%), and preoperative lack of fitness (11.3%). Among all the lists, 43.6% started late and 63.6% of lists finished well before the scheduled closing time. Absence of monitoring equipment and non-availability of additional qualified anaesthetists necessitated induction of anaesthesia in the main operating room and accounted for 11% of the total operating time. CONCLUSION: Delay in starting lists, under-scheduling, interruption due to emergency surgeries, administrative reasons, induction of anaesthesia and recovery policies are the main factors that account for inefficient use of operating facilities. The correction of these factors would increase the available operating time by nearly 20%.},

	abstract = {{Increasing value requires improving quality or decreasing costs. In surgery, estimates for the cost of 1 minute of operating room (OR) time vary widely. No benchmark exists for the cost of OR time, nor has there been a comprehensive assessment of what contributes to OR cost.To calculate the cost of 1 minute of OR time, assess cost by setting and facility characteristics, and ascertain the proportion of costs that are direct and indirect.This cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis examined annual financial disclosure documents from all comparable short-term general and specialty care hospitals in California from fiscal year (FY) 2005 to FY2014 (N = 3044; FY2014, n = 302). The analysis focused on 2 revenue centers: (1) surgery and recovery and (2) ambulatory surgery.Mean cost of 1 minute of OR time, stratified by setting (inpatient vs ambulatory), teaching status, and hospital ownership. The proportion of cost attributable to indirect and direct expenses was identified; direct expenses were further divided into salary, benefits, supplies, and other direct expenses.In FY2014, a total of 175 of 302 facilities (57.9\\%) were not for profit, 78 (25.8\\%) were for profit, and 49 (16.2\\%) were government owned. Thirty facilities (9.9\\%) were teaching hospitals. The mean (SD) cost for 1 minute of OR time across California hospitals was \\$37.45 (\\$16.04) in the inpatient setting and \\$36.14 (\\$19.53) in the ambulatory setting (P = .65). There were no differences in mean expenditures when stratifying by ownership or teaching status except that teaching hospitals had lower mean (SD) expenditures than nonteaching hospitals in the inpatient setting (\\$29.88 [\\$9.06] vs \\$38.29 [\\$16.43]; P = .006). Direct expenses accounted for 54.6\\% of total expenses (\\$20.40 of \\$37.37) in the inpatient setting and 59.1\\% of total expenses (\\$20.90 of \\$35.39) in the ambulatory setting. Wages and benefits accounted for approximately two-thirds of direct expenses (inpatient, \\$14.00 of \\$20.40; ambulatory, \\$14.35 of \\$20.90), with nonbillable supplies accounting for less than 10\\% of total expenses (inpatient, \\$2.55 of \\$37.37; ambulatory, \\$3.33 of \\$35.39). From FY2005 to FY2014, expenses in the OR have increased faster than the consumer price index and medical consumer price index. Teaching hospitals had slower growth in costs than nonteaching hospitals. Over time, the proportion of expenses dedicated to indirect costs has increased, while the proportion attributable to salary and supplies has decreased.The mean cost of OR time is \\$36 to \\$37 per minute, using financial data from California's short-term general and specialty hospitals in FY2014. These statewide data provide a generalizable benchmark for the value of OR time. Furthermore, understanding the composition of costs will allow those interested in value improvement to identify high-yield targets.}},

A detailed scientometric analysis was performed, which is a powerful tool for conducting bibliometric analyses and comprehensive reviews. OR scheduling problems were categorized into three decision levels, including strategical, tactical, and operational levels. Since optimization of OR problems is an NP-hard optimization problem, we evaluated research studies that employed different mathematical and metaheuristic methods to address OR optimization problems. The comprehensive review presented in this work is divided into two sections. The first section is focused on mathematical modeling, including deterministic and uncertainty modeling, and the second section is focused on solution approaches. The latter section reviews single and multi-objective solution methods.

	abstract = {The aim of the Master Surgery Scheduling Problem (MSSP) is to schedule the medical specialties to the different operating rooms available, such that surgeries may be performed efficiently. We consider a MSSP where elective and emergency patients can be treated in the same operating rooms. In addition to elective-dedicated operating room slots, flexible operating room slots are introduced to handle the fluctuating demand of emergency patients. To solve the MSSP, we propose a simulation-optimization approach consisting of a two-stage stochastic optimization model and a discrete-event simulation model. For the two-stage stochastic optimization model, uncertain arrivals of emergency patients are represented by discrete scenarios. The discrete-event simulation model is developed to address uncertainty related to the surgery duration and the length of stay at the hospital, and to test the Master Surgery Schedule (MSS) developed by the optimization model in a stochastic operational-level environment. In addition, the simulation model is used to generate scenarios for the optimization model. We present some general advice for surgery scheduling based on testing the optimization model in a numerical study. The simulation-optimization approach is applied to a case study from a hospital department that treats both elective and emergency patients. The optimized MSS outperforms the manually generated MSS, both in terms of emergency waiting time for surgery, and emergency interruptions to the flow of electives.},

	abstract = {When an outbreak of COVID-19 occurs, it will cause a shortage of medical resources and the surge of demand for hospital beds. Predicting the length of stay LOS of COVID-19 patients is helpful to the overall coordination of hospital management and improves the utilization rate of medical resources. The purpose of this paper is to predict LOS for patients with COVID-19, so as to provide hospital management with auxiliary decision-making of medical resource scheduling. We collected the data of 166 COVID-19 patients in a hospital in Xinjiang from July 19, 2020, to August 26, 2020, and carried out a retrospective study. The results showed that the median LOS was 17.0 days, and the average of LOS was 18.06 days. Demographic data and clinical indicators were included as predictive variables to construct a model for predicting the LOS using gradient boosted regression trees GBRT. The MSE, MAE and MAPE of the model are 23.84, 4.12 and 0.76 respectively. The importance of all the variables involved in the prediction of the model was analyzed, and the clinical indexes creatine kinase-MB CK-MB, C-reactive protein CRP, creatine kinase CK, white blood cell count WBC and the age of patients had a higher contribution to the LOS. We found our GBRT model can accurately predict the LOS of COVID-19 patients, which will provide good assistant decision-making for medical management.},

This study develops a multi-stage linear mixed integer optimization model to optimize the operation time and resource assignment. The decision tree approach addresses the uncertainties in each level of the tree. The proposed model considers three optimistic, most probable, and pessimistic scenarios. Robust Optimization and Upper Partial Moments methods (UPM) are then applied to propose efficient solutions under uncertainty. A case study is presented to compare the solutions proposed by Robust Optimization and UPM methods. The results are compared according to the variance, solution time, and waiting time. We show that the UPM method is superior to the Robust Optimization method in terms of variance and waiting time, while it solves the problem slower.},

@article{x001,
	abstract = {In this paper, we address the need for distributed surgical scheduling across multiple hospitals and multiple days. We develop an effective ex-ante distributed schedule to determine elective service operation and elective patient assignment plan in a hospital alliance with the goal of minimizing the total expected cost considering possible realizations of treatment durations and emergency demands. The problem is formulated into a two-stage stochastic integer programming where uncertainty is characterized by a scenario set. Cancellations of scheduled elective patients and inter-hospital transfers of materialized emergency patients are explicitly modeled as second-stage decisions. To solve the problem, we propose an integer decomposition algorithm that incorporates a novel logic-based optimality cut along with a validity proof. Additionally, we introduce several enhancements to improve the algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms both the commercial solver and the existing integer decomposition algorithm for the proposed problem. It provides effective solutions that closely approach the best upper bounds achieved by the solver in less time, or even surpass the solver's best upper bounds. Furthermore, we provide operational insights into other commonly-used scheduling approaches through numerical comparisons, including the strengths and limitations of the most common way of scheduling elective patients and two strategies for handling emergencies within a hospital alliance.},

When the population is afflicted in various regions, scheduling a fair and acceptable distribution of limited available resources stored in multiple emergency resource centers to each epidemic area has become a serious problem that requires immediate resolution.</sec><sec>MethodsThis study presents an emergency medical logistics model for rapid response to public health emergencies. The proposed methodology consists of two recursive mechanisms: (1) time-varying forecasting of medical resources and (2) emergency medical resource allocation. Considering the epidemic's features and the heterogeneity of existing medical treatment capabilities in different epidemic areas, we provide the modified susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to predict the early stage emergency medical resource demand for epidemics. Then we define emergency indicators for each epidemic area based on this. By maximizing the weighted demand satisfaction rate and minimizing the total vehicle travel distance, we develop a bi-objective optimization model to determine the optimal medical resource allocation plan.</sec><sec>ResultsDecision-makers should assign appropriate values to parameters at various stages of the emergency process based on the actual situation, to ensure that the results obtained are feasible and effective. It is necessary to set up an appropriate number of supply points in the epidemic emergency medical logistics supply to effectively reduce rescue costs and improve the level of emergency services.</sec><sec>ConclusionsOverall, this work provides managerial insights to improve decisions made on medical distribution as per demand forecasting for quick response to public health emergencies.</sec>},

	abstract = {<sec>ProblemThe two waves of COVID-19 severely affected the healthcare system in India. The government responded to the first wave with a strict nationwide lockdown which disrupted primary care, including the management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The second wave overwhelmed healthcare facilities leading to inadequate access to hospital services. Collectively, these issues required urgent responses, including the adaptation of primary care.</sec><sec>ApproachThe Low-Cost Effective Care Unit (LCECU) of Christian Medical College, Vellore (CMC) has a network of community volunteers, community health workers, an outreach nurse, social workers and doctors who operate clinics in six poorer areas of Vellore. The network adapted quickly, responding to the lockdown during the first wave and ensuring ongoing primary care for patients with non-communicable diseases. During the second wave, the team developed a system in collaboration with other CMC departments to provide home-based care for patients with COVID-19.</sec><sec>Local settingThe LCECU is a 48-bed unit of the Department of Family Medicine, part of the 3,000-bed CMC. It originated in 1982, aiming to care for the poor populations of Vellore town. It has been actively working among urban communities since 2002, with a focus on delivering Community Oriented Primary Care (COPC), for six poor urban communities since 2016.</sec><sec>Relevant changesDuring the first wave of COVID the LCECU team ensured patients with NCDs had uninterrupted primary care and medications by visiting them in their homes. The team also addressed food insecurity by organizing a daily lunch service for 600 people for over 2 months. In the second wave, the team responded to community needs by organizing and delivering home-based care to monitor patients affected by COVID-19.</sec><sec>Lessons learnedThe COVID-19 pandemic raises many questions about the preparedness of health systems for disasters that disproportionately affect marginalized populations globally. COVID-19 is only one of the many potential disasters, including non-communicable diseases, mental health problems, pollution, climate change, and lifestyle illness. There is an urgent need to study models of care that support vulnerable communities in an accessible, cost-effective, and patient-oriented way, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This paper outlines lessons on how the LCECU team addressed disaster management:1. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of primary care-based rapid response interventions in disaster management.2. The LCECU model demonstrated the effectiveness of a primary care intervention based on pre-existing networks and familiarity between primary care teams and the community.3. Establishing community-based health care via interdisciplinary teams, including community health workers, community volunteers, outreach nurses, and doctors, is key.4. Addressing other social determinants of health, such as food insecurity, is an important component of care delivery.</sec>},

	abstract = { The emergency hierarchical medical system, a multi-hospital collaborative approach, is one of the innovative healthcare management modes in China during the COVID-19 epidemic. This study aims to prove the waiting cost-saving effectiveness of the emergency hierarchical medical system. Two discrete event simulation models based on this system and traditional admission system will be constructed, and the M/M/1 queue structure with outpatient phase and hospitalization phase will be used to calculate the waiting time of those two systems. Furthermore, we do sensitivity analyses of hospital level, in-hospital disease cross-infection, and resource allocation to get the least costly strategy and to provide operational guidance. In the result, based on the regional virtual hospital structure constructed, the emergency hierarchical medical system outperforms the traditional system when the number of infection patients exceeds a threshold. Besides, the rate of in-hospital cross-infection does not affect the cost-saving effectiveness of system, and the centralized hospital should be set considering the hospital service ability. Moreover, given limited medical resources during the epidemic, the resource allocation between hospitals and patients can be optimized to improve the system's cost-saving. },

	abstract = {To improve surgical services and hospital performance, collaborative operating room planning and scheduling across a network of hospitals has recently emerged as a new challenge in both healthcare industry and academic community. The paper considers a novel distributed operating room scheduling problem (DORSP), in which elective patients planned on a given day are scheduled for surgeries in the distributed operating rooms of collaborative hospitals. Since hospitals are different in terms of specialization and medical expertise, some complicated surgeries in this problem can only be performed in a subset of collaborative hospitals. Based on the similarities between healthcare delivery systems and production systems, DORSP is modelled as a distributed two-stage no-wait hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with factory eligibility. To deal with the NP-hardness of DORSP, an adaptive-learning-based genetic algorithm (ALBGA) is proposed to generate collaborative surgery schedules. In addition to traditional genetic operators, ALBGA also applies an adaptive learning operator to enhance the search ability by mimicking human learning behaviours. Computational results on both small-sized and large-sized test problems show that ALBGA is competitive among the compared algorithms.},

	abstract = {The operating theater is one of the most expensive units in the hospital, representing up to 40% of the total expenses. Because of its importance, the operating room scheduling problem has been addressed from many different perspectives since the early 1960s. One of the main difficulties that has reduced the applicability of the current results is the high variability in surgery duration, making schedule recommendations hard to implement. In this work, we propose a time-indexed scheduling formulation to solve the operational problem. Our main contribution is that we propose the use of chance constraints related to the surgery duration's probability distribution for each surgeon to improve the scheduling performance. We show how to implement these chance constraints as linear ones in our time-indexed formulation, enhancing the performance of the resulting schedules significantly. Through data analysis of real historical instances, we develop specific constraints that improve the schedule, reducing the need for overtime without affecting the utilization significantly. Furthermore, these constraints give the operating room manager the possibility of balancing overtime and utilization through a tuning parameter in our formulation. Finally, through simulations and the use of real instances, we report the performance for four different metrics, showing the importance of using historical data to get the right balance between the utilization and overtime.},

An Lp-metric methodology is applied to solve the final integrated objective function. The MOILP is transformed into a robust optimization model using a transformation framework. In addition, we develop a two-stage stochastic integer linear programming model.

Next, a multi-objective immune algorithm combined with a Q-learning algorithm (Q-MOIA) is developed. In the proposed algorithm, an active decoding heuristic based on the interval insertion mechanism is used to optimize the initial solutions. After that, the clonal selection-based immune algorithm and the Q-learning algorithm are adopted to improve the exploration and exploitation capabilities, respectively, where four objective-driven neighborhood structures are designed. Eventually, extensive computational experiments were conducted on 27 instances under static and dynamic scenarios to demonstrate the superiority and stability of the proposed predictive-reactive dynamic/static rescheduling model and the Q-MOIA. Comparative analysis with four state-of-the-art approaches revealed that proposed Q-MOIA outperformed in approximately 51.9, 66.7, and 83.3 % of the instances for the three multi-objective metrics.},

	abstract = {Home Health Care (HHC) services have emerged as a result of the need to provide care to patients/people who cannot be treated in hospital due to their special conditions and/or need home care. The care and treatment processes provided by this service have been appreciated by researchers as they can be less expensive and just as effective than care provided by a hospital or a skilled care facility. HHC gains importance due to the increasing epidemic disease cases, the increase in the elderly population, etc. In this study, it is aimed to provide high quality service as well as minimizing travel costs by considering the constraints related to travel balancing and type of transportation vehicle. So, environmental and economic factors could be included in the model. The proposed Home Health Care Routing Problem with Health Team Skill Level (HTSL-HHCRP) model was coded in GAMS 24.2.1 software. A new hybrid method named as Genetic Algorithm Simulated Annealing-Marine Predators Algorithm (GASA-MPA) has been developed to solve the large dimensions of the problem. In hybrid approach, SA has been used with an initial point obtained by GA. On the other hand, feasibility of the neighborhood solutions is guaranteed by solving a constraint satisfaction problem via MPA. Test problems'performance was analyzed using the Relative Deviation Index (RDI) evaluation criteria. In addition, the sensitivity of the results according to some parameters selected by scenario analysis was examined. Results confirm the efficiency of the GASA-MPA algorithm in terms of time and objective function. Furthermore, by addressing skill levels of the healthcare team, it is shown that the proposed algorithm performs better than more traditional evolutionary algorithms in HHCRP. The comparisons show that the proposed method outperformed the classical methods not only in terms of best solution, but also the Gap ({\%}) and RDI values.},

	abstract = {Coordinating order acceptance decisions with production scheduling to maximize revenue is challenging for Mass Individualized Prototyping (MIP) service providers. This paper presents a dual deep reinforcement learning agents-based (DDRLA) integrated order acceptance and scheduling (IOAS) for improving revenue. Firstly, a deep reinforcement learning-based virtual production scheduling (VPS) agent together with 8 state features and 11 action rules is designed. The VPS agent quickly and virtually reschedules a dynamically-arriving accepted order to evaluate the overall impact of accepting this order, including consumed capacity and increased revenue. Then, a deep reinforcement learning-based order acceptance decision (OAD) agent is designed. Based on the information guidance resulting from an interaction with the VPS agent, the OAD agent selectively accepts orders to maximize long-term gains, as well as to improve system resilience in the presence of a high ratio of urgent orders. The experiment results show that the proposed DDRLA method has better performance, compared with other IOAS approaches.},

Methods We analyzed numbers of new daily posts for common cancers for one month and subsequently analyzed content of 1426 breast cancer related posts. We also assessed use of online discussion forums for breast cancer related dialogue. Results Breast related topics had significantly more posts per day compared to others (mean 66.7, p < 0.01). Most posts were on media sites (65.8%). Accuracy levels were high (87.5%) but significantly lower where posted on blogs and discussion forums (p < 0.001). Anonymous posts were common (55%) and less likely to be accurate (p < 0.001). Use of discussion forums has exponentially increased over the last five years (p < 0.001). Conclusions The internet has become a primary forum within which health information, particularly relating to breast cancer, is both sought and shared. Increasingly information is provided by patients themselves.},

Although there has been extensive research on FJSSP, its applications in real-world CNC machining scheduling problems have received limited attention, with few related papers. In reality, several critical characteristics within the CNC machining industry can significantly impact the scheduling problem, such as process plan flexibility, multiple resource constraints, and lot streaming. This study aims to establish a scheduling system for the CNC machining industry that integrates order information, work in process information, and the aforementioned characteristics, using a hybrid multi-objective genetic algorithm (HMOGA) combined with local search. The optimal parameter combination for HMOGA is determined through a design of experiments, while the effectiveness of local search is evaluated using computational analysis. Finally, real data from a company is used to validate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the scheduling system developed in this study effectively addresses real-world CNC machining scheduling problems.},

	abstract = {In recent years, integrated production and distribution scheduling (IPDS) has received growing attention from academia and industry. With increasingly global economic activities, it is vital to extend IPDS to distributed environments. Besides, the production and distribution systems are the main contributors to carbon emissions due to their high energy consumption. Driven by this, this work introduces an integrated green distributed production and distribution scheduling problem with the objectives of total tardiness and total carbon emissions minimization. To provide a clear definition, a mixed-integer mathematical programming model is created. Considering the problem's NP-hard nature, a Q-learning-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (Q-MEA) is designed to handle it. To evaluate the performance of Q-MEA, a comparison pool including four variants, five meta-heuristics, and an exact optimizer named CPLEX is constructed to implement numerical experiments. The results demonstrate that Q-MEA has clear advantages over its rivals in tackling our problems. Furthermore, comparing the integrated model with a separate one shows that the former can achieve an average decrease of about 13.10{\%} in total tardiness and 21.02{\%} in total carbon emissions.},

	abstract = {Purpose Influenced by the constantly changing manufacturing environment, no single dispatching rule (SDR) can consistently obtain better scheduling results than other rules for the dynamic job-shop scheduling problem (DJSP). Although the dynamic SDR selection classifier (DSSC) mined by traditional data-mining-based scheduling method has shown some improvement in comparison to an SDR, the enhancement is not significant since the rule selected by DSSC is still an SDR. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a novel data-mining-based scheduling method for the DJSP with machine failure aiming at minimizing the makespan. Firstly, a scheduling priority relation model (SPRM) is constructed to determine the appropriate priority relation between two operations based on the production system state and the difference between their priority values calculated using multiple SDRs. Subsequently, a training sample acquisition mechanism based on the optimal scheduling schemes is proposed to acquire training samples for the SPRM. Furthermore, feature selection and machine learning are conducted using the genetic algorithm and extreme learning machine to mine the SPRM. Findings Results from numerical experiments demonstrate that the SPRM, mined by the proposed method, not only achieves better scheduling results in most manufacturing environments but also maintains a higher level of stability in diverse manufacturing environments than an SDR and the DSSC. Originality/value This paper constructs a SPRM and mines it based on data mining technologies to obtain better results than an SDR and the DSSC in various manufacturing environments.},

By the general position-dependent and time-dependent learning effects we mean that the actual processing time of a job is not only a function of the total normal processing times of the jobs already processed, but also a function of the job's scheduled position. We consider the following objective functions: the makespan, the total completion time, the sum of the θth (θ⩾0) power of job completion times, the total lateness, the total weighted completion time, the maximum lateness, the maximum tardiness and the number of tardy jobs. We show that the problems of minimization of the makespan, the total completion time, the sum of the θth (θ⩾0) power of job completion times and the total lateness can be solved by the smallest (normal) processing time first (SPT) rule, respectively. We also show that the total weighted completion time minimization problem, the discounted total weighted completion time minimization problem, the maximum lateness minimization problem, the maximum tardiness minimization problem and the total tardiness minimization problem can be solved in polynomial time under certain conditions.},

Operating rooms provide a large portion of hospital revenue; hence, scheduling operation room surgeries is very important to maximize profits. This paper reviews the three operating room scheduling problems: the case mix problem, the master surgery scheduling problem and the surgery scheduling problem. Also, the paper introduces a research framework for an integrated planning method for the three problems. Also, the framework includes a broad system dynamics model to analyze the relationship between the different hospital's departments and the operating rooms.},

This taxonomy provides health care managers and OR/MS researchers with a method to identify, break down and classify planning and control decisions. Second, following the taxonomy, for six health care services, we provide an exhaustive specification of planning and control decisions in resource capacity planning and control. For each planning and control decision, we structurally review the key OR/MS articles and the OR/MS methods and techniques that are applied in the literature to support decision making.},

	abstract = {Cloud enterprises are currently facing difficulties managing the enormous amount of data and varied resources in the cloud because of the explosive expansion of the cloud computing system with numerous clients, ranging from small business owners to large corporations. Cloud computing's performance may need more effective resource planning. Resources must be distributed equally among all relevant stakeholders to maintain the group's profit and the satisfaction of its consumers. Since these essential resources are unavailable on the board, a client request cannot be put on hold forever. To address these issues, a hybrid machine learning technique for resource allocation security with effective task scheduling in cloud computing is proposed in this study. Initially, a short scheduler for tasks built around the enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (IPSO-TS) reduces make-span time and increases throughput. Next, bandwidth and resource load are included in a Graph Attention Neural Network (GANN) for effective resource allocation under various design limitations. Finally, NSUPREME, a simple identification technique, is suggested for the encryption process to secure data storage. The proposed method is finally simulated using various simulation settings to demonstrate its effectiveness, and the outcomes are contrasted with those of cutting-edge approaches. The findings indicate that the suggested plan is more efficient than the current one regarding resource use, power usage, responsiveness, etc.},

	abstract = {Objectives The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to scheduling in medical practices has considerable implications for most specialties. However, the landscape of AI and ML use in scheduling optimization is unclear. We aimed to systematically summarize up-to-date evidence about application of AI and ML models for scheduling optimization in clinical settings. Methods We systematically searched multiple databases from inception through August 2020 to identify studies that described real-world application of AI and ML in health care scheduling and reported outcomes. Eligible studies included those conducted in any health care setting using ML or predictive modeling through AI to optimize patient scheduling processes in real-time, real-world settings. Outcomes of interest included assessing impact on stakeholders (ie, providers, patients, health systems), including impact on workload, burden, burnout, cost, utilization, patient and provider satisfaction, waste reduction, and quality. Data were extracted and reviewed in duplicates, independently and blindly by two reviewers. The results were synthesized and summarized using a metanarrative approach. Results The initial search strategy yielded 3,415 citations, of which 11 eligible studies were included. Outcome measures for studies on missed appointments covered patient double-booking volume, missed appointments, service use, and missed appointment risk. Resource allocation outcomes assessed wait time, disease-type matching performance, schedule efficiency revenue, and new patient volume wait time. Other outcomes included visit requests, examination length prediction, and surgical case time. Conclusions Available evidence shows heterogeneity in the stages of AI and ML development as they apply to patient scheduling. AI and ML applications can be used to decrease the burden on provider time, increase patient satisfaction, and ultimately provide more patient-directed health care and efficiency for medical practices. These findings help identify additional opportunities in which AI platforms can be developed to optimize patient scheduling. Public Interest Summary Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can help many aspects of health care. Patient scheduling has significant implications for the cost benefits of improved technology. The long-standing use of technology in medicine serves as a strong foundation for future AI applications. Here, we present an up-to-date review of the current use of AI and ML for schedule optimization in the health care clinic setting. Current evidence shows a wide variety of stages in the development, function, and application of AI and ML in patient scheduling. Given the current gaps of knowledge, future studies should address feasibility, effectiveness, generalizability, and risk of AI bias in patient scheduling.},

	abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}In the face of pandemics, the management of healthcare centers becomes a critical challenge that demands swift and accurate responses. Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role in enhancing healthcare management, providing tools for outbreak prediction, resource optimization, patient triage, and beyond. AI algorithms are capable of analyzing extensive data sets from diverse sources for disease surveillance and outbreak prediction, offering valuable insights for risk assessment and enabling better preparedness. They also contribute to efficient supply chain management and optimize staff allocation by forecasting demand for medical supplies and identifying areas with the most critical needs. AI-powered symptom checkers and triage prioritization systems improve patient flow, while telemedicine, supported by remote monitoring and virtual assistants, reduces hospital congestion. AI aids in infection control through effective contact tracing and sterilization scheduling. Furthermore, AI supports clinical decision-making by providing diagnostic assistance and personalized treatment planning. Acceleration of research is another domain where AI is invaluable, expediting drug discovery and streamlining the design of clinical trials. Information dissemination, crucial during pandemics, is enhanced by AI's ability to tailor communication and combat misinformation. AI also offers support for mental health through counseling services and safeguards data privacy and cybersecurity amidst the increased reliance on digital health data. The full potential of AI in managing healthcare during pandemics is contingent upon the quality and accessibility of data, the seamless integration of AI with current healthcare IT infrastructures, and the strict adherence to ethical standards, ensuring privacy and equitable healthcare delivery.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

	abstract = {The problem of flexible job shop batch scheduling represents an extension of the flexible manufacturing problem. Different batching strategy significantly affects the effect of subsequent scheduling optimization. Therefore, collaborative optimization of the batching strategy and subsequent scheduling is crucial for improving production efficiency. In this paper, a flexible job shop batch production model considering the set-up time is established by analyzing the coupling relationship between batching strategies and scheduling optimization. Based on the proposed model, an improved genetic algorithm with a three-layer coding mechanism is developed to solve the problem of the solution space expansion caused by batch collaboration. The three-layer coding mechanism includes the batch strategy, operation selection, and machine selection. In addition, an operation overlapping strategy is introduced to improve production efficiency and make production more resilient. The proposed algorithm is tested by experiments on scheduling problems of different sizes. The experimental result shows that the proposed method can significantly improve and efficiently optimize flexible job shop scheduling in batch production.},

As such, this paper proposes a novel framework that transforms the combinatorial optimization problem into a multi-stage sequence decision problem and introduces a multi-agent double Deep-Q-network algorithm (MADDQN) for FJSP. The event-driven workshop environment model based on state machine and event stream mechanism is constructed to transform FJSP into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with more robust general performance and decouple the workshop environment model from the decision analysis model. The developed multi-agent reinforcement learning consisting of job agents and machine agents applies dispatching rules to maximize the cumulative reward of all agents by Boltzmann exploitation to avoid the local optimum. Results of numerical experiments reflect that the proposed MADDQN performs better than the traditional approaches in large-scale instances, and the real-time performance of the scheduling decision is guaranteed.},

The efficiency of algorithms using single operator remains recessive in comparison with those with multiple operators. However, use of multiple operators require a selection mechanism, which may not be always as productive as expected; therefore an adaptive selection scheme is always needed. In this study, an experience-based, reinforcement learning algorithm has been used to build an adaptive selection scheme implemented to work with a binary artificial bee colony algorithm in which the selection mechanism learns when and subject to which circumstances an operator can help produce better and worse neighbours. The implementations have been tested with commonly used benchmarks of uncapacitated facility location problem. The results demonstrates that the selection scheme developed based on reinforcement learning, which can also be named as smart selection scheme, performs much better that state-of-art adaptive selection schemes.},

	abstract = {An increased use of renewable energy could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions but is difficult to realize since most renewable energy sources underlie volatile availability. Making use of storage devices and scheduling consumers to times when energy is available allows to increase the amount of renewable energy that can be used. For this purpose, adequate models for forecasting the energy generated and consumed as well as for the behavior of storage devices are essential. Many data-based modeling approaches are computationally costly and therefore difficult to apply in real-world systems. Hence we present a computationally efficient modeling approach using a least-squares regression. Besides, we propose to use a hybrid model approach and evaluate it on real-world data at the examples of modeling the state of charge of a battery storage and the temperature inside a milk cooling tank. The experiments indicate that the hybrid approach leads to better forecasting results, especially for modeling more complicated behavior. Also, it is investigated if the behavior of the models is qualitatively realistic and we find that the battery model fulfills this requirement and is thus suitable for the application in a smart energy management system. Even though forecasts for the hybrid milk cooling model have even lower error values than the ones for the battery storage, further steps need to be taken to avoid undesired effects when using this model in such a sophisticated system.},

This work seeks to compare different Learnheuristics instances composed by Sine Cosine Algorithm and Q-Learning whose different lies in the reward function applied. Preliminary results indicate that there is an influence on the quality of the solutions based on the reward function applied.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the application of Bayesian optimisation to the well-known multidimensional knapsack problem which is strongly NP-hard. For the multidimensional knapsack problem with a large number of items and knapsack constraints, a two-level formulation is presented to take advantage of the global optimisation capability of the Bayesian optimisation approach, and the efficiency of integer programming solvers on small problems. The first level makes the decisions about the optimal allocation of knapsack capacities to different item groups, while the second level solves a multidimensional knapsack problem of reduced size for each item group. To accelerate the Bayesian optimisation guided search process, various techniques are proposed including variable domain tightening, initialisation by the Genetic Algorithm, and optimisation landscape smoothing by local search. Computational experiments are carried out on the widely used benchmark instances with up to 100 items and 30 knapsack constraints. The preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution approach.},

	abstract = {Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) provide an efficient latent space representation of complex data distributions which is learned in an unsupervised fashion. Using such a representation as input to Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches may reduce learning time, enable domain transfer or improve interpretability of the model. However, current state-of-the-art approaches that combine VAE with RL fail at learning good performing policies on certain RL domains. Typically, the VAE is pre-trained in isolation and may omit the embedding of task-relevant features due to insufficiencies of its loss. As a result, the RL approach can not successfully maximize the reward on these domains. Therefore, this paper investigates the issues of joint training approaches and explores incorporation of policy gradients from RL into the VAE's latent space to find a task-specific latent space representation. We show that using pre-trained representations can lead to policies being unable to learn any rewarding behaviour in these environments. Subsequently, we introduce two types of models which overcome this deficiency by using policy gradients to learn the representation. Thereby the models are able to embed features into its representation that are crucial for performance on the RL task but would not have been learned with previous methods.},

	abstract = {Dynamic pricing is a strategy for setting flexible prices for products based on existing market demand. In this paper, we address the problem of dynamic pricing of perishable products using DQN value function approximator. A model-free reinforcement learning approach is used to maximize revenue for a perishable item with fixed initial inventory and selling horizon. The demand is influenced by the price and freshness of the product. The conventional tabular Q-learning method involves storing the Q-values for each state-action pair in a lookup table. This approach is not suitable for control problems with large state spaces. Hence, we use function approximation approach to address the limitations of a tabular Q-learning method. Using DQN function approximator we generalize the unseen states from the seen states, which reduces the space requirements for storing value function for each state-action combination. We show that using DQN we can model the problem of pricing perishable products. Our results demonstrate that the DQN based dynamic pricing algorithm generates higher revenue when compared with conventional one-step price optimization and constant pricing strategy.},

	abstract = {Understanding the phenomenon of disinformation and its spread through the internet has been an increasingly challenging task, but it is necessary since the effects of this type of content have their impacts in the most diverse areas and generate more and more impacts within society. Automated fact-checking systems have been proposed by applying supervised machine learning techniques to assist in filtering fake news. However, two challenges are still present, the first related to understanding disinformation in its subgroups. The second challenge is related to the availability of datasets containing news classified between true and false. This article proposes an exploratory analysis through unsupervised algorithms and the t-SNE technique to visualize data with high dimensionality, identify the subgroups present in the disinformation, and the identification of possible outsiders between the classes. We also propose a new Corpus in Portuguese containing 19446 news, classified as true and false, and 15 linguistic features extracted from this dataset. Finally, we propose to use two classification models using the Random Forest techniques, with and without intruders. In the end, the model without intruder achieved superior performance, reaching an accuracy of 97.33{\%}.},

They play a key role to understand the dynamics of the studied systems and to predict their disruption in case of complex human diseases. BNs are generally built from experimental data and knowledge from the literature, either manually or with the aid of programs. The automatic synthesis of BNs is still a challenge for which several approaches have been proposed. In this paper, we propose ASKeD-BN, a new approach based on Answer-Set Programming to synthesise BNs constrained in their structure and dynamics. By applying our method on several well-known biological systems, we provide empirical evidence that our approach can construct BNs in line with the provided constraints. We compare our approach with three existing methods (REVEAL, Best-Fit and caspo-TS) and show that our approach synthesises a small number of BNs which are covering a good proportion of the dynamical constraints, and that the variance of this coverage is low.},

This paper builds on a generalized procedure for digitization of warehouses where racks and other obstacles are defined using two-dimensional polygons. We extend on this digitization procedure to introduce a layout-agnostic minisum formulation for the Order Batching Problem (OBP), together with a sub-problem for the OBP for a single vehicle, the single batch OBP. An algorithm which optimizes the single batch OBP iteratively until an approximate solution to the OBP can be obtained, is discussed. The formulations will serve as the fundament for further work on layout-agnostic OBP optimization and generation of benchmark datasets.

	abstract = {Cooperative co-evolution is recognized as an effective approach for solving large-scale optimization problems. It breaks down the problem dimensionality by splitting a large-scale problem into ones focusing on a smaller number of variables. This approach is successful when the studied problem is decomposable. However, many practical optimization problems can not be split into disjoint components. Most of them can be seen as interconnected components that share some variables with other ones. Such problems composed of parts that overlap each other are called overlapping problems. This paper proposes a modified cooperative co-evolutionary framework allowing to deal with non-disjoint subproblems in order to decompose and optimize overlapping problems efficiently. The proposed algorithm performs a new decomposition based on differential grouping to detect overlapping variables. A new cooperation strategy is also introduced to manage variables shared among several components. The performance of the new overlapped framework is assessed on large-scale overlapping benchmark problems derived from the CEC'2013 benchmark suite and compared with a state-of-the-art non-overlapped framework designed to tackle overlapping problems.},

Currently, the best solvers are based on hybrid and parallel metaheuristics, which are actually highly complex and parametric methods. Finding the best set of tuning parameters for such methods is a tedious and error-prone task. In this paper, we propose a strategy for auto-parameterization of QAP solvers. We show evidence that auto-parameterization can further improve the quality of computed solutions. Our auto- parameterization scheme relieves the user from having to find the right parameters while providing a high quality solution.},

	abstract = {Dynamic pricing strategies are usually adopted to dynamically adjust the products'prices taking into account demand function characteristics to maximize the revenue. This paper addresses the problem in which a firm has to make decisions about its selling prices in each period to maximize the total profit over the whole horizon. We propose a theoretical analysis of this problem from which we show that: first, when the demand function is linear, the problem can be formulated as a quadratic programming problem. We also present the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker system, which can be used to find the optimal pricing policy when the objective function is concave. Then, when the demand is isoelastic, we also show that the problem can be reduced to the maximization of N independent functions in bounded intervals. Some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the results obtained for both the linear and isoelastic cases.},

To overcome this, we propose to use BnB-NSGAII {$[$}10{$]$} method - a hybrid multi-criteria branch and bound with NSGAII - to initialize NSGAII before solving the problem, seeking for a better initial population. A new feature is also proposed to enhance BnB-NSGAII method, called the legacy feature.

With the increase in the number of properties, the problem needs to be defined as a multi-objective optimisation where objectives are considered independently one from another with the goal of finding and providing decision-makers a large and diverse set of non-dominated solutions/products. Following the optimisation, decision-makers define their own (often complex) preferences on how does the ideal software product look like. Then, they select the unique solution that matches their preferences the most and discard the rest of the solutions---sometimes with the help of some Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis technique. In this work, we study the usability and the performance of incorporating preferences of decision-makers by carrying-out Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis directly within the multi-objective optimisation to increase the chances of finding more solutions that match preferences of the decision-makers the most and avoid wasting execution time searching for non-dominated solutions that are poor with respect to decision-makers'preferences.},

	abstract = {The classical flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) normally assumes that operations of each job have strict sequence constraints, i.e., each operation can be processed only after its previous operation is completed. However, in the actual production, the phenomenon that some operations of a job don't have any sequence constraints is very common. With regard to this, we firstly propose a FJSP with discrete operation sequence flexibility (FJSPDS) aiming at minimizing the makespan and total energy consumption, simultaneously. An effective mathematical model is established for the FJSPDS and its validity is proved by the CPLEX; and then an improved memetic algorithm (IMA) is designed to solve the FJSPDS. In the IMA, a new flexible sequencing method for determining process plan of each job and a right-leaning decoding method are proposed. And some effective crossover and mutation operators and an effective local search operator are designed to accelerate the convergence speed and expand the solution space of the algorithm. A total of 110 FJSPDS benchmark instances are constructed to conduct numerical simulation experiments. Experimental results show that our proposed IMA has superior performance in almost all of the instances compared with three well-known evolutionary algorithms. Our proposed model and algorithm can help the production managers who work with flexible manufacturing systems to obtain optimal scheduling schemes considering operations which have or don't have sequence constraints.},

	abstract = {This bachelor thesis aims to identify sustainable optimization options for reducing energy consumption of the CT scanners within the radiology department of Medisch Spectrum Twente (MST), a hospital in Enschede, the Netherlands. The research aligns with MST's objectives of sustainability, care quality, education, and scientific advancements. The Dutch government's ambitious targets to reduce CO2 emissions further emphasize the need for energy-efficient healthcare facilities. The study focuses on the scheduling problem associated with the CT scanners and utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation approach implemented in Excel VBA. Two key heuristics, namely the Longest-Expected-Processing-Time-first (LEPT) and Shortest-Expected-Processing-Time-first (SEPT) algorithms, are employed to minimize the total makespan. The simulation generates scan requests and their corresponding processing times, and the results demonstrate that implementing LEPT leads to a 26% improvement in average completion times compared to the current scheduling system. This improvement translates into a potential annual reduction of 16473 kWh in energy consumption, equivalent to the average energy consumption of three three-person households per year in the Netherlands. The research findings highlight the potential of connecting data with the CT scheduling system to improve energy efficiency, reduce CO2 emissions, and create a more sustainable hospital environment. The study contributes to the scientific understanding of scheduling in stochastic environments and provides practical insights for healthcare facilities seeking to optimize energy consumption and scheduling algorithms.},

	abstract = {Many outpatient radiology orders are never scheduled, which can result in adverse outcomes. Digital appointment self-scheduling provides convenience, but utilization has been low. The purpose of this study was to develop a ``frictionless''scheduling tool and evaluate the impact on utilization. The existing institutional radiology scheduling app was configured to accommodate a frictionless workflow. A recommendation engine used patient residence, past and future appointment data to generate three optimal appointment suggestions. For eligible frictionless orders, recommendations were sent in a text message. Other orders received either a text message for the non-frictionless app scheduling approach or a call-to-schedule text. Scheduling rates by type of text message and scheduling workflow were analyzed. Baseline data for a 3-month period prior to the launch of frictionless scheduling showed that 17{\%} of orders that received an order notification text were scheduled using the app. In an 11-month period after the launch of frictionless scheduling, the rate of app scheduling was greater for orders that received a text message with recommendations (frictionless approach) versus app schedulable orders that received a text without recommendations (29{\%} vs. 14{\%}, p < 0.01). Thirty-nine percent of the orders that received a frictionless text and scheduled using the app used a recommendation. The most common recommendation rules chosen for scheduling included location preference of prior appointments (52{\%}). Among appointments that were scheduled using a day or time preference, 64{\%} were based on a rule using the time of the day. This study showed that frictionless scheduling was associated with an increased rate of app scheduling.},

	abstract = {In this paper, operating room planning and scheduling problems have been studied. In operating room planning, the allocation of patients to operating rooms and their sequencing are critical in determining the performance of operating rooms. In this paper, three surgery scheduling decisions are considered, including the number of operating rooms to open, the allocation of surgeries to operating rooms, and the sequencing of surgeries in allocated operating rooms. All the surgeries under consideration are elective, and surgery durations are considered deterministic. Further, it is considered that the surgeries have different specialties, and each operating room can accommodate a particular specialty of surgeries, i.e., heterogeneous operating rooms are considered in the current study. Before performing a surgery, setup time is required for operating room turnover and sterilization, and it is considered sequence dependent. A mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is developed to minimize the overtime costs of operating rooms for allocation and surgery sequencing with sequence dependent setup times. An outer approximation (OA) method is proposed to solve the problem near optimally. Experiments are conducted to compare the performance of the proposed OA method with the standard mixed integer nonlinear programming model. Computational results show the efficiency of the proposed OA method. Later, a case data from a case hospital is collected and a case study is solved.},

	abstract = {{Surgical waiting lists have risen dramatically across the UK as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The effective use of operating theatres by optimal scheduling could help mitigate this, but this requires accurate case duration predictions. Current standards for predicting the duration of surgery are inaccurate. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers the potential for greater accuracy in predicting surgical case duration. This study aimed to investigate whether there is evidence to support that AI is more accurate than current industry standards at predicting surgical case duration, with a secondary aim of analysing whether the implementation of the models used produced efficiency savings.PubMed, Embase, and MEDLINE libraries were searched through to July 2023 to identify appropriate articles. PRISMA extension for scoping reviews and the Arksey and O'Malley framework were followed. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the reporting guidelines for surgical AI papers by Farrow et al. Algorithm performance was reported using evaluation metrics.The search identified 2593 articles: 14 were suitable for inclusion and 13 reported on the accuracy of AI algorithms against industry standards, with seven demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in prediction accuracy (P \\&lt; 0.05). The larger studies demonstrated the superiority of neural networks over other machine learning techniques. Efficiency savings were identified in a RCT. Significant methodological limitations were identified across most studies.The studies suggest that machine learning and deep learning models are more accurate at predicting the duration of surgery; however, further research is required to determine the best way to implement this technology.}},

	abstract = {Big data processing frameworks utilizing distributed frameworks to parallelize the computing of datasets have become a staple part of the data engineering and data science pipelines. One of the more known frameworks is Dask, a widely utilized distributed framework used for parallelizing data processing jobs. In Dask, the main component that traverses and plans out the execution of the job is the scheduler. Dask utilizes a centralized scheduling approach, having a single server node as the scheduler. With no failover mechanism implemented for the scheduler, the work in progress is potentially lost if the scheduler fails. As a consequence, jobs that might have been executed for hours or longer need to be restarted. In this thesis, a highly available scheduler is designed, based on Dask. We introduce a highly-available scheduler that replicates the state of the job on a distributed key-value store. The replicated schedulers allow us to design an architecture where the schedulers are able to take over the job in case of a scheduler failure. To reduce the performance overhead of replication, we further explore optimizations based on partitioning typical task graphs and sending each partition to its own scheduler. The results show that the replicated scheduler is able to tolerate server failures and is able to complete the job without restarting but at a cost of reduced throughput due to the replication. This is mitigated by our partitioning, which achieves almost linear performance gains relative to our baseline fault-tolerant scheduler, through the utilization of a parallelized scheduling architecture.},

	abstract = {Hospitals use medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) more often to give patients quality continuous care. MCPS isa life-critical, context-aware, networked system of medical equipment. It has been challenging to achieve high assurance in system software, interoperability, context-aware intelligence, autonomy, security and privacy, and device certifiability due to the necessity to create complicated MCPS that are safe and efficient. The MCPS system is shown in the paper as a newly developed application case study of artificial intelligence in healthcare. Applications for various CPS-based healthcare systems are discussed, such as telehealthcare systems for managing chronic diseases (cardiovascular diseases, epilepsy, hearing loss, and respiratory diseases), supporting medication intake management, and tele-homecare systems. The goal of this study is to provide a thorough overview of the essential components of the MCPS from several angles, including design, methodology, and important enabling technologies, including sensor networks, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and multi-agent systems. Additionally, some significant applications are investigated, such as smart cities, which are regarded as one of the key applications that will offer new services for industrial systems, transportation networks, energy distribution, monitoring of environmental changes, business and commerce applications, emergency response, and other social and recreational activities.The four levels of an MCPS's general architecture---data collecting, data aggregation, cloud processing, and action---are shown in this study. Different encryption techniques must be employed to ensure data privacy inside each layer due to the variations in hardware and communication capabilities of each layer. We compare established and new encryption techniques based on how well they support safe data exchange, secure computing, and secure storage. Our thorough experimental study of each method reveals that, although enabling innovative new features like secure sharing and safe computing, developing encryption approaches significantly increases computational and storage overhead. To increase the usability of newly developed encryption schemes in an MCPS and to provide a comprehensive list of tools and databases to assist other researchers, we provide a list of opportunities and challenges for incorporating machine intelligence-based MCPS in healthcare applications in our paper's conclusion.},

	abstract = {Based on AI technology, this study proposes a novel large-scale emergency medical supplies scheduling (EMSS) algorithm to address the issues of low turnover efficiency of medical supplies and unbalanced supply and demand point scheduling in public health emergencies. We construct a fairness index using an improved Gini coefficient by considering the demand for emergency medical supplies (EMS), actual distribution, and the degree of emergency at disaster sites. We developed a bi-objective optimisation model with a minimum Gini index and scheduling time. We employ a heterogeneous ant colony algorithm to solve the Pareto boundary based on reinforcement learning. A reinforcement learning mechanism is introduced to update and exchange pheromones among populations, with reward factors set to adjust pheromones and improve algorithm convergence speed. The effectiveness of the algorithm for a large EMSS problem is verified by comparing its comprehensive performance against a super-large capacity evaluation index. Results demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in reducing convergence time and facilitating escape from local optima in EMSS problems. The algorithm addresses the issue of demand differences at each disaster point affecting fair distribution. This study optimises early-stage EMSS schemes for public health events to minimise losses and casualties while mitigating emotional distress among disaster victims.},

	abstract = {Over the last few years, at ByteDance, our compute infrastructure scale has been expanding significantly due to expedited business growth. In this journey, to meet hyper-scale growth, some business groups resorted to managing their own compute infrastructure stack running different scheduling systems such as Kubernetes, YARN which created two major pain points: the increasing resource fragmentation across different business groups and the inadequate resource elasticity between workloads of different business priorities. Isolation across different business groups (and their compute infrastructure management) leads to inefficient compute resource utilization and prevents us from serving the business growth needs in the long run.To meet these challenges, we propose a resource management and scheduling system named G{\"o}del, which provides a unified compute infrastructure for all business groups to run their diverse workloads under a unified resource pool. It co-locates various workloads on every machine to achieve better resource utilization and elasticity. G{\"o}del is built upon Kubernetes, the de facto open-source container orchestration system, but with significant components replaced or enhanced to accommodate various workloads at a large scale. In production, it manages clusters with tens of thousands of machines, achieves high overall resource utilization of over 60\%, and scheduling throughput of up to 5000 pods per second. This paper reports on our design and implementation with G{\"o}del. Moreover, it discusses the lessons and best practices we learned in developing and operating it in production at ByteDance's scale.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the flexible flow shop scheduling problem with unloading operations, which commonly occurs in modern manufacturing processes like sand casting. Although only a few related works have been proposed in the literature, the significance of this problem motivates the need for efficient algorithms and the exploration of new properties. One interesting property established is the symmetry of the problem, where scheduling from the first stage to the last or vice versa yields the same optimal solution. This property enhances solution quality. Considering the problem&rsquo;s theoretical complexity as strongly NP-Hard, approximate solutions are preferable, especially for medium and large-scale instances. To address this, a new two-phase heuristic is proposed, consisting of a constructive phase and an improvement phase. This heuristic builds upon an existing efficient heuristic for the parallel machine-scheduling problem and extends it to incorporate unloading times efficiently. The selection of the two-phase heuristic is justified by its ability to generate high-quality schedules at each stage. Moreover, new efficient lower bounds based on estimating minimum idle time in each stage are presented, utilizing the polynomial parallel machine-scheduling problem with flow time minimization in the previous stage. These lower bounds contribute to assessing the performance of the two-phase heuristic over the relative gap performance measure. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark test problems, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The results indicate an average computation time of 9.92 s and a mean relative gap of only 2.80% for several jobs up to 200 and several stages up to 10.},

	abstract = {A hybrid flow shop group scheduling problem (HFGSP) involves two distinct sub-problems, the arrangement of groups and the configuration of jobs within each group. Constructing its mathematical model based on the classification of these sub-problems can help better understand the problem's characteristics. However, the existing literature fails to establish MILP models of HFGSP based on the interrelation between each subproblem and the respective process constraints satisfied by each subproblem. To address this gap, our study first categorizes all the constraints in the HFGSP according to several factors: group arrangement, job arrangement within the group, process requirements between groups, process requirements between jobs from the same group, process requirements between adjacent stages, and the relationship between the decision variables of completion time and the objective constraint. Following this classification, we construct 48 available MILP models of HFGSP. Additionally, we also propose an efficient constraint programming (CP) model of HFGSP. Numerous experiments are conducted to verify the correctness and performance of all 48 MILP models across different test instances, analyze the complexities of all models, and excavate their intrinsic characteristics. Through our evaluation for the 48 models, we observe that models 24 and 48 exhibit superior performance. This highlights the effectiveness of the hybrid modeling approach, which synergistically combines sequence-based modeling for groups and position-based adjacent modeling for jobs within each group. The utilization of this hybrid modeling approach enables the construction of high-quality MILP models for addressing the HFGSP problem. Our intention is to bridge the gap between MILP modeling of HFGSP and problem-specific algorithms, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the problem and offering potential solutions.},

	abstract = {Rising costs for energy are increasingly becoming a vital factor for the production planning of manufacturing companies. Manufacturers face the challenge to react to dynamic energy prices and design energy cost efficient schedules in their production planning. In the literature, the energy cost-aware Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem addresses minimization of both makespan and energy costs. Recent studies provide multi-objective approaches to model the trade-off of minimizing makespan and energy costs. However, the literature is limited to coarse-grained time periods and does not consider dynamic tariffs where costs change at short intervals, so that production schedules may fall short on energy costs. We aim to close this research gap by considering frequently changing real-time energy tariffs. We propose a multi-objective memetic algorithm based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) with both makespan and energy cost minimization as the objectives. We evaluate our approach by conducting computational experiments using prominent FJSP-benchmark instances from the literature, which we supplement with empiric dynamic energy prices. We show results on method performance and compare the memetic NSGA-II with the results of an exact state-of-the-art solver.

	abstract = {Given the increasing severity of ecological issues, sustainable development and green manufacturing have emerged as crucial areas of research and practice. The continuous growth of the globalizing economy has led to the prevalence of distributed manufacturing systems. Distributed flow-shop scheduling problem (DFSP) is a complex NP-hard problem that involves two highly coupled sub-problems: job allocating for factories and job sequencing within factories. This paper proposes an efficient Q-learning-based multi-objective particle swarm optimization (QL-MoPSO) to address the DFSP, with the objectives of minimizing makespan and total energy consumption. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has been enhanced by dividing particles into three subgroups, enabling faster convergence to three distinct areas of the Pareto Front (PF). Q-learning guides variable neighborhood search (VNS) as a local search strategy, balancing exploration and exploitation capabilities. To make the algorithm more reasonable and efficient for solving DFSP, multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MoPSO) uses the exchange sequence to update the job sequence vector, crossover and mutation to update the factory assignment vector. Computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm accelerates convergence and ensures good distribution performance and diversity, outperforming traditional multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.},

Today, AI is being used to assist in the diagnostic and administrative process. However, since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an emergence in utilizing AI and robotics to protect healthcare workers from patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of AI to improve the working conditions of healthcare workers; healthcare workers are at significant risks of not only disease, but abuse and stress as well. This study reviews AI applications and AI strategies for the healthcare sector in Bahrain and AI contribution to marketing, and achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Benchmarking will be done with AI applications of healthcare for other countries. The study findings have revealed that Bahrain has an outstanding achievement in AI which will have the leverage to meet SDG goals 3 of ``Good Health and Well-Being'', 11 of ``Sustainable Cities and Communities'', and 15″Life on Land''of 2030 Bahrain's vision. On the other hand, further studies will be required for the development of applying AI to surgical precise treatment procedures to avoid human mistakes. In addition, an application should be launched for scheduling of delivery timing of medicine to patients. Furthermore, applying complex AI machine learning should be done within radiological scans sooner the better for identifying and defending malignant tumors.},

Initiatives to improve attendance typically involve expensive and ineffective brute-force strategies. The aim was to develop machine learning models to accurately predict ophthalmic clinic non-attendance. Methods This multicentre, retrospective observational study developed and validated predictive models of clinic non-attendance. Attendance data for 3.1 million appointments from all New Zealand government-funded ophthalmology clinics from 2009 to 2018 were aggregated for analysis. Repeated ten-fold cross validation was used to train and optimise XGBoost and logistic regression models on several demographic and clinic-related variables. Models developed using the entire training set were compared with those restricted to regional subsets of the data. Results In the testing data set from 2019, there were 407?574 appointments (median {$[$}range{$]$} age, 66 {$[$}0?105{$]$} years; 210?365 {$[$}51.6{\%}{$]$} female) with a non-attendance rate of 5.7{\%} (n?=?23?309 missed appointments), XGBoost models trained on each region's data achieved the highest mean AUROC of 0.764 (SD 0.058) and mean AUPRC of 0.157 (SD 0.072). XGBoost performed better than logistic regression (mean AUROC?=?0.756, p?=?0.002). Training individual XGBoost models for each region led to better performance than training a single model on the complete nationwide dataset (mean AUROC?=?0.754, p?=?0.04). Conclusion Machine learning algorithms can predict ophthalmic clinic non-attendance with relatively basic demographic and clinic data. These findings suggest further research examining implementation of such algorithms in scheduling systems or public health interventions may be useful.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to design a weekly surgery schedule in an operating theatre where time blocks are reserved for surgeons rather than specialities. Both operating rooms and places in the recovery room are assumed to be multifunctional, and the objectives are to maximise the utilisation of the operating rooms, to minimise the overtime cost in the operating theatre, and to minimise the unexpected idle time between surgical cases. This weekly operating theatre planning and scheduling problem is solved in two phases. First, the planning problem is solved to give the date of surgery for each patient, allowing for the availability of operating rooms and surgeons. Then a daily scheduling problem is devised to determine the sequence of operations in each operating room in each day, taking into account the availability of recovery beds. The planning problem is described as a set-partitioning integer-programming model and is solved by a column-generation-based heuristic (CGBH) procedure. The daily scheduling problem, based on the results obtained in the planning phase, is treated as a two-stage hybrid flow-shop problem and solved by a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA). Our results are compared with several actual surgery schedules in a Belgian university hospital, where time blocks have been assigned to either specific surgeons or specialities several months in advance. According to the comparison results, surgery schedules obtained by the proposed method have less idle time between surgical cases, much higher utilisation of operating rooms and produce less overtime.},

	abstract = {Flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP) is a new research hotspot in the field of production scheduling. To solve the multiobjective FJSP problem, the production of flexible job shop can run normally and quickly. This research takes into account various characteristics of FJSP problems, such as the need to ensure the continuity and stability of processing, the existence of multiple objectives in the whole process, and the constant complexity of changes. It starts with deep learning neural networks and genetic algorithms. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) are combined in deep learning neural networks. The new improved algorithm is based on the combination of deep learning neural networks LSTM and CNN with genetic algorithm (GA), namely, CNN-LSTM-GA algorithm. Simulation results showed that the accuracy of the CNN-LSTM-GA algorithm was between 85.2\&{\#}x0025; and 95.3\&{\#}x0025; in the test set. In the verification set, the minimum accuracy of the CNN-LSTM-GA algorithm was 84.6\&{\#}x0025;, both of which were higher than the maximum accuracy of the other two algorithms. In the FJSP simulation experiment, the AUC value of the CNN-LSTM-GA algorithm was 0.92. After 40 iterations, the F1 value of the CNN-LSTM-GA algorithm remained above 0.8, which was significantly higher than the other two algorithms. CNN-LSTM-GA is superior to the other two algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy and overall performance of FJSP. It is more suitable for solving the discrete manufacturing job scheduling problem with FJSP characteristics. This study significantly raises the utilisation rate of the assembly shop\&{\#}x2019;s equipment, optimises the scheduling of FJSP, and fully utilises each processing device\&{\#}x2019;s versatile characteristics, which are quite useful for the production processes of domestic vehicle manufacturing companies.},

However, the effective designs of PDRs and mathematical modelings are tedious and complex relying heavily on a myriad of specialized knowledge. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically learn PDRs based on Graph Node Embedding (GNE) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We describe JSSP as a disjunctive graph and utilize a GNE approach to facilitate better state embeddings. Ablation studies demonstrate the significant positive contribution of GNE both on JSSP and JSSP-MT. Experiments show that some high-quality combined PDRs can be learned with better approximate solutions against the traditional single PDRs. Solutions produced by our approach are much closer to those from mathematical solvers than previous methods. },

	abstract = {Uncertainty pervades real life and supposes a challenge for all industrial processes as it makes it difficult to predict the outcome of otherwise risk-free activities. In particular, time deviation from projected objectives is one of the main sources of economic losses in manufacturing, not only for the delay in production but also for the energy consumed by the equipment during the additional unexpected time they have to work to complete their labour. In this work we deal with uncertainty in the flexible job shop, one of the foremost scheduling problems due to its practical applications. We show the importance of a good model to avoid introducing unwanted imprecision and producing artificially pessimistic solutions. In our model, the total energy is decomposed into the energy required by resources when they are actively processing an operation and the energy consumed by these resources simply for being switched on. We propose a set of metrics and carry out an extensive experimental analysis that compares our proposal with the more straightforward alternative that directly translates the deterministic model. We also define a local search neighbourhood and prove that it can reach an optimal solution starting from any other solution. Results show the superiority of the new model and the good performance of the new neighbourhood.},

With the help of incentive-based programmes, grid operators can incentivise consumers to adjust power demand in critical situations such that grid stability is not threatened. On the consumer side, energy-efficient scheduling models can be used to make energy consumption more flexible. This paper proposes a bi-objective job-shop scheduling problem with variable machine speeds that aims on minimising the total energy consumption and total weighted tardiness simultaneously. We use a genetic algorithm to solve the model and derive Pareto frontiers to analyse the trade-off between both conflicting objectives. We gain insights into how incentive-based programmes can be integrated into machine scheduling models and analyse the potential interdependencies and benefits that result from this integration.},

	abstract = {Shortages of medical equipment, growth in medical waste and carbon emissions have increased healthcare pressures and has a huge impact on the environment. An efficient scheduling of medical equipment will effectively reduce the pressure on healthcare and improve the healthcare system's ability to respond to unexpected disasters. A medical equipment scheduling system was established to improve the sustainable utilization of medical equipment within the healthcare network and to reduce the carbon emissions of the healthcare process. First, this paper combines medical equipment information to establish a medical equipment scheduling decision model that considers pollution to filter qualified medical equipment for scheduling. Then, this paper constructs and solves a multi-objective robust optimization model by collecting the patient's travel information and the medical pressure information of each region. In addition, to meet dynamic healthcare needs, a dynamic medical equipment configuration framework was constructed to enhance the flexibility of equipment scheduling and the resilience of the healthcare network. Combined with case studies, the results show that the medical equipment scheduling system can help decision makers make quick scheduling decisions and achieve sustainable use of medical equipment, with a corresponding increase in medical equipment utilization of 12.25% and a reduction in carbon emissions of 26.50%. The study will help enhance healthcare resource utilization and contribute to the net-zero goal of green healthcare.},

	n2 = {The Permutation Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (PFSP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem that has been extensively studied in the literature. Traditional approaches, such as metaheuristics, have been widely used to tackle this problem, but often face limitations related to parameter selection, computational time, and the generation of initial solutions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the utilization of two machine learning models based on the CatBoost regressor algorithm, tailored to the number of machines involved in the scheduling problem. By combining these two models with the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) metaheuristic, we enhance its performance significantly. The first model focuses on generating high-quality initial solutions that outperform the commonly used NEH heuristic, all while maintaining computational efficiency. On the other hand, the second model is designed to expedite the enhancement of a given schedule through an efficient local search approach. To assess the efficacy of our proposed approach, we conducted extensive experiments, comparing its performance against traditional techniques using Taillard instances as benchmarks. The results of our evaluation consistently showcased the superiority of our approach, surpassing the performance of the benchmarked methods.},

	abstract = {This paper studies a Permutation Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (PFSSP) considering maintenance activities and energy consumption, in which machine failures obey Weibull distribution. In case of an unexpected failure, a Corrective Maintenance (CM) policy is triggered automatically. Moreover, Preventive Maintenance (PM) as a proactive maintenance strategy is introduced to improve deteriorating effects and reduce the probability of failures. Then, a multi-objective production-maintenance joint optimization model is proposed. Compared to the traditional PFSSP, this joint model is more complex. To solve it, a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based solution approach is designed with specific state sets, action sets and reward functions. Numerical studies show that the application of RL in integrated scheduling has high solution performance by comparing with seven heuristic rules. },

This is compounded by the current stresses these services face, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and increasing burden of musculoskeletal conditions. It is vital that measures are taken to alleviate the pressures on these systems, to ensure timely and quality access to care for patients. This literature review presents a taxonomic classification of the applications of Operational Research and Management Science (OR/MS) methodologies to orthopaedic care settings and treatments, covering the general, medical, and methodological context of each paper. Our structured search identified 492 relevant publications that have been included in our analysis. The results found a literature largely dominated by cost analysis applications, typically utilising Markov models or decision trees. Key gaps identified in this review include the lack of holistic modelling of orthopaedic systems and pathways, and limited applications to resource and capacity planning. The implications of our review are that researchers, healthcare professionals and managers can develop a research agenda to address these gaps, and enhance decision support in orthopaedics.},

Although vaccination provides protection, the duration of this protection wanes over time. Additional doses can restore immunity, but the influence of viral variants, specific sequences, and vaccine-induced immune responses on disease severity remains unclear. Moreover, the efficacy of therapeutic interventions during hospitalisation requires further investigation. The study aims to analyse the clinical course of COVID-19 in hospitalised patients, taking into account SARS-CoV-2 variants, viral sequences, and the impact of different vaccines. The primary outcome is all-cause in-hospital mortality, while secondary outcomes include admission to intensive care unit and length of stay, duration of hospitalisation, and the level of respiratory support required.</p><h2>Methods.</h2> <p>This ongoing multicentre study observes hospitalised adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, utilising a combination of retrospective and prospective data collection. It aims to gather clinical and laboratory variables from around 35,000 patients, with potential for a larger sample size. Data analysis will involve biostatistical and machine-learning techniques. Selected patients will provide biological material. The study started on October 14, 2021 and is scheduled to end on October 13, 2026.</p><h2>Discussion.</h2> <p>The analysis of a large sample of retrospective and prospective data about the acute phase of SARS CoV-2 infection in hospitalised patients, viral variants and vaccination in several European and non-European countries will help us to better understand risk factors for disease severity and the interplay between SARS CoV-2 variants, immune responses and vaccine efficacy. The main strengths of this study are the large sample size, the long study duration covering different waves of COVID-19 and the collection of biological samples that allows future research.</p><h2>Registration</h2> <p>.

	abstract = {Currently, the healthcare of elderly people arouses widespread concerns since the sharp increase of aging population puts severe stress on public medical resources. Home health care (HHC) is regarded as an alternative answer to hospitalization, while it plays an important role in reducing healthcare cost and improving service satisfaction. This work addresses a service resource routing and scheduling problem with sharing strategy among multiple HHC centers for given customers. Two objective functions are involved: minimizing the total operation cost including the fixed usage cost of centers, caregiver usage cost and service cost, and minimizing the total tardiness caused by delay service. Firstly, a mixed integer programming model is formulated to describe the concerned problem. Secondly, a multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm with problem-specific knowledge (MABC-PK) is proposed. Three problem-specific knowledge-based heuristics are designed to initialize population. A crossover operation and a self-learning neighborhood selection method are developed to prompt collaborative search of population and external archive. Furthermore, two knowledge-based local search methods are proposed for refining solutions in the external archive via employing some observations and priority properties derived from the problem characteristics. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted by comparing the proposed approach with four widely-acknowledged multi-objective optimization methods and a mathematical programming solver CPLEX. The comparative results and statistical analysis confirm the strong competitiveness of MABC-PK for solving the concerned problem.},

Here, our concern is investigating expensive and complex decisions to provide healthcare services during the outbreak of an infectious disease such as SARS a , Ebola, seasonal influenza and influenza pandemic b , COVID-19 pandemic, while available capacities are overwhelmed by the heavy influx of patients. The complexity of such tactical/operational decisions during pandemics may even turn their scope into triage decisions which may entail unknown future cost-trajectories. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, these decisions are categorized into preparedness and response plans to be performed before the declaration of a pandemic, in anticipation of such events and respectively, after its declaration to hedge its fatalities. We also highlight decision-making practices designed to allocate strategic investments for public-health policy-making purposes with conflicting and costly objectives to combat epidemics/pandemics at state-and national-level governments.

Many techniques have been proposed to improve the results for large-scale problems where the exact solution is unknown. Some notable approaches include Tabu search, Genetic algorithms, Dynamic programming, among others. One technique of particular interest to us is Constraint Programming, which is commonly used to model and solve optimizations problems. Recently, a new variable called the sequence variable has been introduced, primarily for modeling routing problems such as the Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP) and the Patient Transportation Problem (PTP). The objective of this master's thesis is to investigate the potential of using the sequence variable to efficiently model scheduling problems and find optimal solutions. To this end, we will explore whether this variable can improve the modeling capabilities and performance of Constraint Programming in solving the Job-Shop problem.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses a stochastic job shop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times, aiming to minimize the expected maximum lateness. The stochastic nature is modeled by considering uncertain times between failures (TBF) and uncertain times to repair (TTR). To tackle this problem, a simheuristic approach is proposed, which combines a tabu search (TS) algorithm with Monte Carlo simulation. A total of 320 instances were used to conduct multiple experiments. Instances were generated with two distributions to study the behavior of stochastic TTR and TBF under log-normal and exponential distributions. Firstly, the performance of the simheuristic was evaluated for small instances by comparing it with the simulation of optimal solutions obtained with a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. The simheuristic approach demonstrated an average improvement of around 7{\%} compared to the simulation of MILP model solutions. Secondly, the simheuristic performance was evaluated for medium and large-size instances by comparing it with the simulation of the solutions obtained by the earliest due date (EDD) and process time plus work in the next queue plus negative slack (PT + WINQ + SL) dispatching rules. The results showed an average improvement of around 11{\%} compared to EDD and 14{\%} compared to PT + WINQ + SL. Furthermore, the results highlight that even when the two distributions have the same expected value and coefficient of variation, they can yield different expected maximum lateness values. This emphasizes the importance of precise distribution fitting when solving real cases to achieve effective scheduling performance.},

	abstract = {The post-disaster surgical scheduling is a type of scheduling problem in healthcare system that occurs after a sudden disaster event. The rescue capacity of hospitals has faced an unprecedented challenge by increasing surgical loads due to the disaster occurrence. Hospital became excessively burdened by the influx of patients, who occupy inpatient beds and operation rooms (ORs), making the availability of medical resources uncertain and scarce. This paper focuses on the post-disaster surgical scheduling problem, considering uncertain demands such as the unknown surgical operation durations or random arrivals of emergency/urgent patients, as well as the interests of multiple stakeholders (patients and hospital managers). The objective of fuzzy post-disaster surgical scheduling (FPDSS) is to simultaneously minimize the expected recovery completion time for all patients (makespan), expected average makespan while prioritizing emergency/ urgent patients, as well as the expected total idle time of ORs. This problem can be formulated as a mixed integer linear multi-objective optimization model, and an improved hunger games search based on Nash equilibrium (IHGS-NE) is developed for FPDSS. Finally, experimental studies have been used to test the performance of the proposed approach, and the presented surgical scheduling scheme is validated. Results show that the IHGS-NE approach is an effective method on the research of the multi-objective FPDSS problem.},

The scheduling deviations caused by the impact of internal and external environment are easy to lead the rescheduling. By introducing the digital twin (DT), the scheduling deviation between actual and planned production can be captured and the deviation can be expressed quantitatively to trigger rescheduling strategies more precisely. For the real-time scheduling problem (RSP), a DT-based deviation detection method and scheduling framework are proposed. A multi-objective model for RSP and a rescheduling strategy based on deviation detection are developed. In addition, an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (INSGA-II) is proposed to solve the RSP. The algorithm combines the adaptive mutation method and the neighborhood search method. Finally, an assembly job shop is taken as a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed framework and methodology.},

	abstract = {Customer profiles have rapidly changed over the past few years, with products being requested with more customization and with lower demand. In addition to the advances in technologies owing to Industry 4.0, manufacturers explore autonomous and smart factories. This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent system (MAS), including intelligent agents that can respond to their environment autonomously through learning capabilities, to cope with an online machine shop scheduling problem. In the proposed system, agents participate in auctions to receive jobs to process, learn how to bid for jobs correctly, and decide when to start processing a job. The objective is to minimize the mean weighted tardiness of all jobs. In contrast to the existing literature, the proposed MAS is assessed on its learning capabilities, producing novel insights concerning what is relevant for learning, when re-learning is needed, and system response to dynamic events (such as rush jobs, increase in processing time, and machine unavailability). Computational experiments also reveal the outperformance of the proposed MAS to other multi-agent systems by at least 25{\%} and common dispatching rules in mean weighted tardiness, as well as other performance measures.},

	abstract = {As the only largest source of revenue and cost in a hospital, the operation room (OR) scheduling problem is a hot research topic. Nonetheless, an integrated model is the missing key to managing and improving the efficiency of ORs. This paper presents a fully integrated model regarding three concepts: meditating elective patients and emergency patients together, considering ORs and downstream units, and proposing hierarchical weekly, daily, and rescheduling models. Due to the inherent randomness in emergency patient arrival, a random forest machine learning model and geographical information systems are used to obtain the emergency patient surgery duration and arrival time, respectively. According to the machine learning model in weekly and daily scheduling, initially, fixed capacity is reserved for emergency patients. When an emergency patient arrives, the surgery starts if a reserved OR is available. Otherwise, the first available OR will be dedicated to the patient due to an emergency patient's higher priority than an elective patient. In this case, it is needed to reschedule the OT schedule for the remaining patient. Moreover, the three-phase model guarantees that an emergency patient assigns to an OR within a specific time limit. To solve the models, genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization are developed and compared. In addition, a real-world case study is undertaken at a hospital. The results of comparing the proposed approach to the hospital's current scheduling show that the three-phase model had a considerable positive effect on the ORs schedule.},

	abstract = {Machines deteriorate as they perform production operations, leading to increased production cost rates. When the deterioration reaches a certain level, the machine may break down, which disrupts production and requires costly Corrective Maintenance (CM) to restore operation. Preventive Maintenance (PM) can improve machine health but requires production downtime and expenses. Thus, to balance the increased production cost from degradation against the maintenance cost, it is important to jointly optimize production and maintenance scheduling. This paper aims to address the joint optimization problem for a multi-machine system to achieve the optimal overall business reward under incomplete information and system production demand constraints. We propose a novel method called Knowledge Enhanced Reinforcement Learning (KERL), which adopts a centralized multi-agent actor-critic architecture. KERL enhances the performance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for multi-machine production and maintenance scheduling by leveraging the prior knowledge of the constraint to determine the production decisions and handle the cooperation among machines in the system. The performance of KERL is evaluated in both deterministic and stochastic case studies and is compared to three baseline methods. Results show that KERL achieves a higher overall business reward than baseline methods and learns to avoid failures in the stochastic environment.},

Although it has effectively handled a variety of optimisation problems, the surgical scheduling problem (SSP) has not yet been solved by hyper-heuristic. Therefore, we aim to investigate the effectiveness of applying hyper-heuristics to solve a real-world SSP at Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz UKM (HCTM), one of Malaysia's largest public hospitals. We dealt with daily SSP for block scheduling strategy. The daily SSP arranges the sequence of surgical cases in each operating room (OR) for each day, considering the material and human resource availability. In this work, we aim to maximise the number of surgeries and OR utilisation for a given time horizon while solving SSP. In hyper-heuristic, high-level strategy is heuristic selection mechanism where we applied elitism-based genetic algorithm (E-GAHH). Low level heuristics are problem-specific heuristics where we applied simple move operators. Experimental result demonstrate that E-GAHH approach can provide a more practical and effective schedule with more OR utilisation than HCTM's solution and traditional genetic algorithm hyper-heuristic (GAHH) approach.},

Current methods for monitoring ED queue states, such as manual monitoring, video surveillance, and front-desk registration are inefficient, invasive, and delayed to provide real-time updates. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework, CrowdQ, which harnesses spatiotemporal crowdsensing data for real-time ED demand sensing, queue state modeling, and prediction. By utilizing vehicle trajectory and urban geographic environment data, CrowdQ can accurately estimate emergency visits from noisy traffic flows. Furthermore, it employs queueing theory to model the complex emergency service process with medical service data, effectively considering spatiotemporal dependencies and event context impact on ED queue states. Experiments conducted on large-scale crowdsensing urban traffic datasets and hospital information system datasets from Xiamen City demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. It achieves an F1 score of 0.93 in ED demand identification, effectively models the ED queue state of key hospitals, and reduces the error in queue state prediction by 18.5\%-71.3\% compared to baseline methods. CrowdQ, therefore, offers valuable alternatives for public emergency treatment information disclosure and maximized medical resource allocation.},

For DJSP, the available methods aways complete the job selection first and then search for an appropriate factory to assign the selected job, which means job selection and job assignment are done independently. This paper proposes an end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method to make the two decisions simultaneously. To capture the problem characteristics and realize the objective optimization, the Markov Decision Process (MDP) of DJSP is formulated. Specialised action space made up of operation-factory pairs is designed to achieve the simultaneous decision-making. A stitched disjunctive graph representation of DJSP is specially designed, and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based feature extraction architecture is proposed to dig the state embedding during problem solving. A Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) method is applied to train an action-selection policy. To further lead the agent to assign jobs to the factory with smaller makespan, a probability enhancement mechanism is designed. The experimental results on 240 test instances have shown that the proposed method outperforms 8 classical Priority Dispatching Rules (PDRs), 3 closely-related RL methods and 5 metaheuristics in terms of effectiveness, stability and generalization.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the uncertainties and complexity in the production process, due to the boosted customized requirements, has dramatically increased the difficulties of Dynamic Flexible Job Shop Scheduling (DFJSP). This paper investigates a new DFJSP model taking into account the minimum completion time under the condition of machine processing time uncertainty, e.t. VPT-FJSP problem. In the formulated VPT-FJSP process, each workpiece needs to be processed by required machine at a certain time slot where Markov decision process (MDP) and reinforcement learning methods are adopted to solve VPT-FJSP. The agent designed in this paper employs the Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO) algorithm in deep reinforcement learning, which includes the Actor-Critic network. The input of the network is to extract the processing information matrix and to embed some advanced states in the workshop by graph neural network, which enables the agent to learn the complete state of the environment. Finally, we train and test the proposed framework on the canonical FJSP benchmark, and the experimental results show that our framework can make agent better than genetic algorithm and ant colony optimization in most cases, 94.29{\%} of static scheduling. It is also shown superiority compared to the scheduling rules in dynamic environment and has demonstrated strong robustness in solving VPT-FJSP. Furthermore, this study conducted tests to assess the generalization capability of the agent on VPT-FJSP at different scales. In terms of exploring Makespan minimization, the agent outperformed four priority scheduling rules. These results indicate that the proposed dynamic scheduling framework and PPO algorithm are more effective in achieving superior solutions.},

The empirical findings revealed that appointment lead-time, appointment time, weekday appointments, online doctor rating, appointment doctor's expertise, patient distance, and previous outpatient visit experience significantly influenced patients' missed appointment behaviors from online outpatient bookings. Importantly, previous outpatient experience positively moderated the relationship between the appointment doctor's expertise and patients' missed-appointment behavior. This study provides insights into the factors influencing patients' missed-appointment behavior from online outpatient bookings. It further offers a theoretical foundation for medical institutions in China to mitigate the likelihood and adverse effects of patients' missed-appointment behavior from online outpatient bookings.},

In addition, the disparate departments are locally (department-centric) organized, leading to prolonged waiting times for patients. The proposed integral patient scheduling model incorporates the status and information of all departments in the outpatient clinic along with all possible pathways to direct patients, on their arrival, to the optimal path. The developed hybrid ant agent algorithm identifies the optimal path to reduce the patient waiting time and cycle time (time from registration to exit). An outpatient clinic in Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai, has a huge volume of walk-in patients and was selected for this study. The simulation study was performed for diverse scenarios followed by implementation study. The results indicate that integral patient scheduling reduced waiting time significantly. The path optimization in real time makes scheduling effective and efficient as it captures the changes in the outpatient clinic instantly.},

Later, in the second half of 2020, or WHO published a roadmap for prioritizing the uses of COVID-19 vaccines (Faden et al. 2022) and many governments published detailed prioritization schedules for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, which were scarce goods at the turn of 2020 and 2021. Unlike guidelines on medical treatment (Hans-J{\"o}rg et al., 2021), official schedules on the distribution of medical prevention have not yet been analyzed or compared in scholarly journals. Thus, the main aim of our project was to provide the first systematic international comparison of the official prioritization schedules for vaccinations in 29 countries (EU, UK, and Israel) and to analyze the values and principles implicitly embedded in these documents. Our study was published in the Journal of Law and the Biosciences in 2022 (Wi{\'s}niowska et al. 2022). Although some scholars suggest that prioritization during the pandemic raises structurally similar dilemmas in the cases of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention (Emanuel et al. 2020), we highlight and analyze the specific nature of allocation decisions in the case of prevention.},

	abstract = {The widespread application of clinical pathways has improved the quality of medical care in hospitals in China, enabling patients to better medical services. However, due to the large population base in China, the therapeutic resources are relatively few, and the medical resources of the hospital are also limited. The resource scheduling problem of the clinical pathway is gradually highlighted. In this paper, the clinical pathway resource scheduling problem is abstracted as a multi-project scheduling problem under resource constraints, and the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized to complete the resource scheduling optimization experiment on the clinical pathway of type2 diabetes. At the same time, aiming at the problem that particle swarm optimization is easy to fall into local optimum, the grey wolf algorithm is combined with particle swarm optimization. Finally, the particle swarm optimization algorithm and the grey wolf algorithm are compared with the improved algorithm. The experimental results show that when the number of patients treated increases, the results obtained by the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm are better than the particle swarm optimization algorithm and the grey wolf algorithm, effectively avoiding the problem of a local optimal solution.},

	abstract = {Emergency Departments (EDs) in hospitals typically aim to deliver accurate and rapid treatment to patients. The scheduling of patients in EDs is a challenging task that depends not only on the triage process but also on the availability of both human (staff) and material resources. In this paper, a real case study is conducted to tackle the issues coming from crowding and long waiting times for patients processing at the largest hospital in the region of Sfax (Tunisia). An integer programming formulation is proposed to minimize total patient waiting times (PWT) in EDs subject to procedural and staff availability constraints. Due to the large scale of the treated problem, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is developed as a solution method. The efficiency of the presented approach is evaluated based on diverse sets of theoretically and randomly generated instances in a first way and on the actual data obtained from the real case study hospital in a second way. Results show significant improvements compared to the First Come First Served (FCFS) real case study's rule. The decrease in patient waiting time ranges between 18.84 % to 27.45%.},

	abstract = {Accounting for the stochastic nature of environmental outcomes when quantifying economic environmental trade-offs with mathematical programming models requires the use of probabilistic programming approaches like the upper partial moment (UPM) method. Application of the UPM model may result in overregulation and losses in farm profit because the probabilistic constraint is satisfied at a higher level than the specified compliance probability, resulting in conservative responses from polluters. The main objective of this article was to present the upper frequency method as an alternative to enforce a probabilistic constraint with a close bound to the actual compliance probability. The UFM uses binary variables in a linear programming framework to enforce the probability bound on an empirically distributed outcome variable. Results showed that the UPM model was very conservative in the estimation of the upper probability bound, which resulted in an overestimation of abatement costs and an underestimation of the average amount of pollution above the environmental goal. Inconsistencies also exist between the ranking of alternatives when comparing the UPM and UFM methods. The UFM is general enough to ensure that the technique can be applied to any problem where the researcher is concerned with the risk of exceeding a specified target level.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we obtain the optimal selection rule for ordering uncertain prospects for all individuals with decreasing absolute risk averse utility functions. The optimal selection rule minimizes the admissible set of alternatives by discarding, from among a given set of alternatives, those that are inferior (for each utility function in the restricted class) to a member of the given set. We show that the Third Order Stochastic Dominance (TSD) rule is the optimal rule when comparing uncertain prospects with equal means. We also show that in the general case of unequal means, no known selection rule uses both necessary and sufficient conditions for dominance, and the TSD rule may be used to obtain a reasonable approximation to the smallest admissible set. The TSD rule is complex and we provide an efficient algorithm to obtain the TSD admissible set. For certain restrictive classes of the probability distributions (of returns on uncertain prospects) which cover most commonly used distributions in finance and economics, we obtain the optimal rule and show that it reduces to a simple form. We also study the relationship of the optimal selection rule to others previously advocated in the literature, including the more popular mean-variance rule as well as the semi-variance rule.},

In these conditions, it is inevitable to encounter some disruptions and breakdowns which are inherently stochastic events. These disruptions quickly cause the initial schedule to become infeasible and non-optimal and in need of appropriate revisions and rescheduling methods. In this paper, a different approach is considered to achieving a stable schedule despite the arrival of new unpredicted jobs into the process. This approach proposes an appropriate reactive method to deal with this unexpected event so that the best sequence can be determined in this dynamic system based on classical objectives and other performance measures.

	abstract = {The main difficulty of a logistic management problem is in the face of uncertainty about the future. Since many logistic models encounter uncertainty and noisy data in which variables or parameters have the probability of occurrence, a highly promising technique of solving stochastic optimization problems is the robust programming proposed by Mulvey et al. (Operations Research 43(2) (1995a) 264--281) and Mulvey and Ruszczynski (Operations Research 43 (3) (1995b) 477--490). However, heavy computational burden has prevented wider applications in practice. In this study, we reformulate a stochastic management problem as a highly efficient robust optimization model capable of generating solutions that are progressively less sensitive to the data in the scenario set. The method proposed herein to transform a robust model into a linear program only requires adding n+m variables (where n and m are the number of scenarios and total control constraints, respectively). Whereas, the current robust programming methods proposed by Mulvey et al., Mulvey and Ruszczynski and Bai et al. (Management Science 43 (7)(1997) 895--907) require adding 2n+2m. Two logistic examples, logistic management problems involving a wine company and an airline company, demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed model.},

Difficulties with such data are typically dealt with reactively-through sensitivity analysis-or proactively-through stochastic programming formulations. In this paper, we characterize the desirable properties of a solution to models, when the problem data are described by a set of scenarios for their value, instead of using point estimates. A solution to an optimization model is defined as: solution robust if it remains `close` to optimal for all scenarios of the input data, and model robust if it remains `almost` feasible for all data scenarios. We then develop a general model formulation, called robust optimization (RO), that explicitly incorporates the conflicting objectives of solution and model robustness. Robust optimization is compared with the traditional approaches of sensitivity analysis and stochastic linear programming. The classical diet problem illustrates the issues. Robust optimization models are then developed for several real-world applications: power capacity expansion; matrix balancing and image reconstruction; air-force airline scheduling; scenario immunization for financial planning; and minimum weight structural design. We also comment on the suitability of parallel and distributed computer architectures for the solution of robust optimization models.},

Then for performance assessment of the methods, a simulation-based evaluation system is designed. The evaluation system concentrates on both the general efficiency of the methods individually, and their comparative performances versus each other.

	abstract = {To meet the increase in demand for outpatient surgical services, surgery scheduling for outpatient procedure centres (OPCs) has recently attracted considerable attention in both the healthcare industry and the academic community. This paper considers a novel OPC daily surgery scheduling problem (ODSSP) to minimise the average recovery completion time of all patients. To satisfy the OPC surgical practice, patient intake and recovery are applied in the same area for more resource flexibility, and uncertain service times for intake, surgical procedures and recovery are considered. Owing to the similarities shared between healthcare delivery systems and production systems, ODSSP is formulated as a two-stage no-wait re-entrant hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with fuzzy service times. Considering the NP-hardness of such scheduling problem, a new hybrid meta-heuristic (GA-BAVNS) is employed to obtain detailed daily OPC surgery schedules. To achieve greater balance between exploration and exploitation in the search space, GA-BAVNS hybridises a genetic algorithm (GA) and a variable neighbourhood search (VNS) to schedule outpatients for surgical services. To improve the local search performance of the VNS, six novel block-based neighbourhood structures are employed to generate neighbourhood solutions. Moreover, an adaptive neighbourhood change procedure (ANCP) is employed to systematically change the search order of neighbourhood structures for better solutions. Computational results on a set of test problems indicate the superiority of the proposed GA-BAVNS.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses a planning decision for operating rooms (ORs) that aim at supporting hospital management. Focusing on elective patients, we determined the master surgical schedule (MSS) on a one-week time horizon. We assigned the specialties to available sessions and allocated surgeries to them while taking into consideration the priorities of the outpatients in the ambulatory surgical discipline. Surgeries were selected from the waiting lists according to their priorities. The proposed approach considered operating theater (OT) restrictions, patients'priorities and accounted for the availability of both intensive care unit (ICU) beds and post-surgery beds. Since the management decisions of hospitals are usually made in an uncertain environment, our approach considered the uncertainty of surgery duration and availability of ICU bed. Two robust optimization approaches that kept the model computationally tractable are described and applied to deal with uncertainty. Computational results based on a medium-sized French hospital archives have been presented to compare the robust models to the deterministic counterpart and to demonstrate the price of robustness.},

	abstract = {Long wait times for health care services is a known challenge in most health care systems. This is partially due to limited capacity and increased demand, but also due to sub-optimal scheduling policies. In this paper, we consider a health system in which patients are prioritized based on their acuity level. We assume that there is a wait time target for each acuity level to ensure that patients of lower acuity do not wait for an unreasonable amount of time while higher acuity patients are being served. We apply a robust optimization (RO) approach to schedule patients over a multi-period finite horizon considering the wait targets. First, we present a deterministic mixed-integer programming model which considers patient priorities, available capacity, and wait time targets for each priority level. We then investigate the robust counterpart of the model by considering uncertainty in demand and employing the notion of budget of uncertainty. Finally, we numerically compare the proposed robust model with the deterministic method. Our results demonstrate that the proposed robust approach provides solutions with higher service levels and lower wait times. Our results also provide insights on how expanding capacity and choosing the level of uncertainty affect the performance of the system.},

	abstract = {Surgery is a vital process in Healthcare Centers (HCs). The importance of a surgery department is not only due to its direct impact on the health but also due to its high impact on the income and costs of HCs. Considering the upward trend of population aging in societies, increasing demand for surgery, and limited resources of HCs, providing an efficient schedule for Operating Room (OR) is essential. In this paper, a multi-objective mathematical model is proposed considering upstream and downstream units. The proposed model consists of three objectives in which the first one minimizes the number of deferred patients to the next planning horizon. The second one minimizes the waiting cost of scheduled patients and the cost of extra beds acquired in the ward, and the last one minimizes the idleness and overtime of ORs, lateness in operating children and earliness in operating patients far from HC. Then, the robust counterpart is proposed to evaluate some uncertain parameters, such as surgery t, Length of Stay (LoS) in upstream and downstream units and emergency demand. Since this problem is NP-hard, a new Mixed Integer Programming based Local Search Neighborhood (MIP-based LNS) algorithm is applied. Afterward, the effect of increasing number of slots on the CPU time is studied using a sensitivity analysis. Finally, a real case study entitled `Alborz Hospital'is investigated. The obtained results show that applying the proposed model and increasing two beds in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) could potentially decrease the number of deferred patients by 58.33{\%} as compared to the traditional schedule (i.e., a schedule based on trial and error). Furthermore, the average idleness of ORs could be reduced by 36.58{\%} as compared to the traditional schedule.},

	abstract = {Adequate access to health care is one of the main strategic axes considered in the Portuguese National Health Plan. This plan seeks to ensure the best performance and adequacy of care maximizing the use of resources, quality, equity and access. This work results from a close collaboration with a large and publicly funded Portuguese hospital. The aim is to propose a systematic approach to help the surgical planner in the scheduling of elective surgeries, in order to optimize the use of the available surgical resources, and improve equity and access to operated and waiting patients. The decisions to be taken by this surgical case assignment problem are twofold: select patients to be scheduled in the planning horizon from a large waiting list for surgery; and assign a day, an operating room, and a time block to the selected patients. Three versions are modeled in (mixed) integer linear programming: from the administration's intention up to the surgeons'current practice, and a halfway reflecting a negotiation with the surgeons. A robust approach is proposed to tackle the uncertain surgeries'duration without the need to assume a given distribution for these random parameters and allowing to control the level of conservatism in the solutions. Practical and real-sized problems from the hospital are solved providing very good optimization gaps within a short time limit, both for the deterministic and robust approaches. The schedules obtained are analyzed regarding quality and robustness, and are also compared with the surgical schedules performed by the hospital.},

The surgery scheduling problem is to assign surgeries to ORs and assign surgery start times so as to minimize the sum of idle times of ORs and late start times for surgeries. Employing historical data provided by a large university hospital, this research provides a mathematical formulation for the problem, proposes a series of heuristics, and develops a Monte Carlo simulation model for planned surgeries to minimize the penalty. Our research demonstrates that the changes proposed can shorten the delayed start duration for surgeries and the idle times for ORs. The results can be helpful to the decision makers in hospital settings who are considering minimizing delays in surgeries start times and ORs idle times while dealing with the stochastic nature of surgery times.},

	abstract = {The required time for surgical interventions in operating rooms (OR) may vary significantly from the predicted values depending on the type of operations being performed, the surgical team, and the patient. These deviations diminish the efficient utilization of OR resources and result in the disruption of projected surgery start times. This paper proposes a two-stage chance-constrained model to solve the OR scheduling problem under uncertainty. The goal is to minimize the costs associated with OR opening and overtime as well as reduce patient waiting times. The risk of OR overtime is controlled using chance constraints. Numerical experiments show that the proposed model provides a better trade-off between minimizing costs and reducing solution variability when compared to two existing models in the literature. It is also shown that the three models converge as the overtime probability threshold approaches one. Moreover, it is observed that the individual chance constraints result in the opening of fewer rooms, lower waiting times, and shorter solution times when compared to that of joint chance constraints. A decomposition algorithm is applied that solves large test instances of the OR scheduling problem, that of which is known to be NP-hard. Strong valid inequalities are derived in order to accelerate the convergence speed. The proposed approach outperformed both a commercial solver and a basic decomposition algorithm after solving all test instances with up to 89 surgeries and 20 ORs in less than 48 minutes.},

A meta-heuristic approach integrating Pareto sets and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is proposed to solve such multi-objective OR scheduling optimization problem. The Pareto sets construction and the modified ant graph model is introduced and two types of pheromone setting and updating strategies are compared to determine a more efficient multi-objective OR scheduling algorithm. The scheduling results by four different approaches, i.e. the simulation, the ACO with single objective of makespan (ACO-SO), the ACO with multi-objective by weighted sum method (ACO-weighted-sum), and the hybrid Pareto set-ACO with multi-objectives (PSACO-MO) are compared. The test case in the literature, which is from MD Anderson Cancer Center, is also used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The computational results show that the PSACO-MO achieves good results in shortening makespan, reducing nurses'overtime and balancing resources'utilization in general.},

METHODS: A multiple objective stochastic programming model is constructed to seek a satisfactory surgical scheduling for both patients and hospitals under different scenarios. Multi-objective genetic algorithm is designed to solve the model and different scales of scenarios are utilized to test the effectiveness of the algorithm and modeling process. RESULTS: Results show that the proposed model and algorithm can provide a feasible solution for maximizing individual preference of surgeons with surgery date and operation room utilization as well.

The operating room department is typically one of the most costly units in a hospital. Hospital managers are always interested in finding effective ways of using operating rooms to minimize operating costs. In this research, we study the operating room scheduling problem. We consider the use of a weekly surgery schedule with an open scheduling strategy that takes into account the availabilities of surgeons and operating rooms. The objective is to minimize the total operating cost while maximizing the utilization of the operating rooms but also minimizing overtime use. A revised mathematical model is proposed that can provide optimal solutions for a surgery size up to 110 surgical cases. Next, two modified heuristics, based on the earliest due date (EDD) and longest processing time (LPT) rules, are proposed to quickly find feasible solutions to the studied problem. Finally, an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm that incorporates the initial solutions, a recovery scheme, local search schemes, and an elitism strategy is proposed. The computational results show that, for a surgery size between 40 and 100 surgical cases, the ABC algorithm found optimal solutions to all of the tested problems. For surgery sizes larger than 110 surgical cases, the ABC algorithm performed significantly better than the two proposed heuristics. The computational results indicate that the proposed ABC is promising and capable of solving large problems.},

	abstract = {Operating room managers are facing increasingly complex challenges, namely in complying with waiting time targets before surgery. This paper proposes a framework that combines optimization and simulation to generate dynamic master surgery schedules for a long planning horizon, in which the schedules are optimized by an integer programming model and the demand levels are modelled using the simulation model. The developed approach allows the resulting operating room plan to balance waiting lists as it assigns more time to the specialties with higher demand in terms of time needed to perform all the surgeries in the corresponding waiting lists. The analysis of the results obtained for the proposed flexible rolling horizon approach were proven robust, and were compared to static and flexible long-term approaches, the former not allowing flexibility and the latter using a deterministic update of the demand. Considering throughput, tardiness and waiting time, the flexible rolling horizon approach showed the best results, while the static one had the worst results.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we develop a stochastic optimization model for a surgical scheduling problem considering a single operating room. We arrange a set of elective surgeries into appropriate time blocks, and determine their planned start time and specific sequence. Due to the complexity of the original formulation, we reformulate our model as a two-stage mixed-integer problem. We consider the planning decision in the first stage and the sequencing decision in the second stage (based on the first one). The goal of this paper is to obtain a nearly optimal schedule in reasonable computational time. The term ``optimal''is defined as the lowest surgically related cost while achieving the given threshold with respect to some specific deterministic or stochastic performance measures. The optimization model involves expected and probabilistic formulations that are analytically intractable. This implies that traditional mathematical programming techniques cannot be used directly. Therefore, we propose adapted rapid-screening and stochastic-approximation algorithms to deal with the first-stage and the second-stage problems, respectively. In both algorithms, we can apply either the Laplace transform or simulation methods to either evaluate or estimate the desired performance measures. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are more favorable compared to existing approaches.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses a new variant of the daily operating room scheduling problem in which, surgeries have stochastic durations, and in order to get a more flexible schedule, the initial scheduling and the rescheduling decisions are simultaneously considered within a single optimization model. The main point in the formulation of this problem is that the time of the uncertainty realization is decision dependent and hence, the uncertainty is of endogenous nature which is a new topic in stochastic programming (SP) literature. First, a novel mathematical model is developed for this problem, and an illustrative example is provided to justify the importance of the joint optimization of scheduling and rescheduling decisions. Then, the structure of the proposed model is utilized to develop a genetic algorithm (GA) to solve large instances of this NP-hard optimization problem. Computational experiments on some randomly generated test problems, confirm the efficiency of the proposed GA in terms of the solution quality and time. Moreover, the results indicate that a cost reduction may be achieved by integrating scheduling and rescheduling decisions.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the Operating Room (OR) planning problem at an operational planning level. The problem addressed consists of two interrelated sub-problems usually referred to as ``advance scheduling''and ``allocation scheduling''. In the first sub-problem, the decisions considered are the assignment of a surgery date and an OR block to a set of patients to be operated on over a given planning horizon. The second aims at determining the sequence of selected patients in each OR and day. We assume that the duration of surgeries are random variables with known probability distributions. For each sub-problem an integer linear stochastic formulation is given. A hybrid two-phase optimization algorithm which exploits the potentiality of neighborhood search techniques combined with Monte Carlo simulation is developed to solve the overall problem. The approach developed searches for a feasible and robust solution designed to balance the trade-off arising between the hospital and patient perspectives, i.e. maximizing the OR utilization and minimizing the number of patient cancellations. The contribution of this paper is twofold. The former, more methodological, is to provide an efficient algorithmic framework to solve the joint advance and allocation scheduling problem taking into account the inherent uncertainty of surgery durations. The latter, more practical, is to provide a tool to develop robust offline OR schedules which consider the trade-off between reducing surgery cancellations and postponements while maximizing the operating theater utilization. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithmic approach, in terms of quality of solutions and solution time, we provide a computational analysis on a set of instances based on real data.},

Thus, this research focuses on the dynamic configuration scheduling problem for stochastic medical resources. In this paper, the surgical operating room is limited, and the arriving calls (i.e., number of patients) are dynamic. When a patient arrives, the nurse anesthetist and anesthesiologist are limited, but the medical service duration per patient is random. We introduce the drum-buffer-rope (DBR) scheduling approach to analyze which types of medical resources become bottleneck resources for optimizing operating room scheduling.

	abstract = {We address a stochastic operating room scheduling problem which consists of assigning an intervention date and operating room to surgeries on the waiting list, minimizing the under- and overtime costs of the operating rooms, and the cost of exceeding the capacity constraints of the system. Uncertainties in surgeries duration, in the arrivals of emergency surgeries and in surgeons'capacity are considered. To solve the problem we propose a Monte Carlo optimization method based on the sample average approximation method, which combines an iterative greedy local search method and Monte Carlo simulation. The performance of the iterative greedy local search method is evaluated against an exact method and two existing heuristic methods for solving the deterministic version of the problem, using testbeds generated based on the literature. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to evaluate the performance of the Monte Carlo optimization method in a stochastic setting. The results show that the objective function value converges with exponential rates when the number of samples increases, obtaining an optimality index value around 1 {\%}. By comparing the results against the solution obtained by the corresponding deterministic expected value problem, we conclude that an important cost reduction can be obtained by solving the stochastic problem rather than the deterministic one.},

	abstract = {In this work we consider the problem of selecting a set of patients among a given waiting list of elective patients and assigning them to a set of available operating room blocks. We assume a block scheduling strategy in which the number and the length of available blocks are given. As each block is related to a specific day, by assigning a patient to a block his/her surgery date is fixed, as well. Each patient is characterized by a recommended maximum waiting time and an uncertain surgery duration. In practical applications, new patients enter the waiting list continuously. Patient selection and assignment is performed by surgery departments on a short-term, usually a week, regular base. We propose a so-called rolling horizon approach for the patient selection and assignment. At each iteration short-term patient assignment is decided. However, in a look-ahead perspective, a longer planning horizon is considered when looking for the patient selection. The mid-term assignment over the next {\$}{\$}n{\$}{\$}weeks is generated by solving an ILP problem, minimizing a penalty function based on total waiting time and tardiness of patients. The approach is iteratively applied by shifting ahead the mid-term planning horizon. When applying the first week solution, unpredictable extensions of surgeries may disrupt the schedule. Such disruptions are recovered in the next iteration: the mid-term solution is rescheduled limiting the number of variations from the previously computed plan. Besides, the approach allows to deal with new patient arrivals. To keep limited the number of disruptions due to uncertain surgery duration, we propose also a robust formulation of the ILP problem. The deterministic and the robust formulation based frameworks are compared over a set of instances, including different stochastic realization of surgery times.},

	abstract = {A general problem in health-care consists in allocating some scarce medical resource, such as operating rooms or medical staff, to medical specialties in order to keep the queue of patients as short as possible. A major difficulty stems from the fact that such an allocation must be established several months in advance, and the exact number of patients for each specialty is an uncertain parameter. Another problem arises for cyclic schedules, where the allocation is defined over a short period, e.g. a week, and then repeated during the time horizon. However, the demand typically varies from week to week: even if we know in advance the exact demand for each week, the weekly schedule cannot be adapted accordingly. We model both the uncertain and the cyclic allocation problem as adjustable robust scheduling problems. We develop a row and column generation algorithm to solve this problem and show that it corresponds to the implementor/adversary algorithm for robust optimization recently introduced by Bienstock for portfolio selection. We apply our general model to compute master surgery schedules for a real-life instance from a large hospital in Oslo.},

	abstract = {This article addresses the problem of allocating limited operating room (OR) capacity among subspecialties in hospitals where two types of demands exist: elective surgeries and emergency surgeries. In many medium- and small-scale hospitals, no OR capacity is affiliated with a particular subspecialty, but several subspecialties share the OR capacity in the hospital. The administrator needs to decide how much OR capacity to assign to each subspecialty and how much to reserve for emergency surgeries. Because such an allocation is usually decided several weeks or even months before, the only information about future demands is their range. We focus on finding a robust solution that handles disturbances in the surgery demand. An adjustable robust model is developed to solve this surgery capacity allocation problem with demand uncertainty. The worst-case revenue loss resulting from a shortage of OR resources is minimised. We examine the impact of conservativeness of the robust model on the revenue loss of the surgery department, which provides hospital administrators guidance for setting the adjustable parameters. An implementer-adversary algorithm is applied to solve the robust optimisation model. We present computational results comparing the proposed robust optimisation approach with a scenario-based stochastic optimisation; the results show that by adjusting the conservatism, the expected objective value realised by the robust solution is very close to that obtained by the stochastic programming approach. Moreover, the robust optimisation method has the benefit of limiting the worst-case outcome of the surgery capacity allocation problem.},

By benchmarking with some known models, the analysis reveals that the proposed model yields a decreasing in gap of the usages of OR resources by considering the no-show. An admission plan created by the model indicates a better performance that results in fewer deviations between actual and target utilisations while satisfying the given restrictions.

	abstract = {In 2000, Chile introduced profound health reforms to achieve a more equitable and fairer system (GES plan). The reforms established a maximum waiting time between diagnosis and treatment for a set of diseases, described as an opportunity guarantee within the reform. If the maximum waiting time is exceeded, the patient is referred to another (private) facility and receives a voucher to cover the additional expenses. This voucher is paid by the health provider that had to do the procedure, which generally is a public hospital. In general, this reform has improved the service for patients with GES pathologies at the expense of patients with non-GES pathologies. These new conditions create a complicated planning scenario for hospitals, in which the hospital's OR Manager must balance the fulfillment of these opportunity guarantees and the timely service of patients not covered by the guarantee. With the collaboration of the Instituto de Neurocirug{\'\i}a, in Santiago, Chile, we developed a mathematical model based on stochastic dynamic programming to schedule surgeries in order to minimize the cost of referrals to the private sector. Given the large size of the state space, we developed an heuristic to compute good solutions in reasonable time and analyzed its performance. Our experimental results, with both simulated and real data, show that our algorithm performs close to optimum and improves upon the current practice. When we compared the results of our heuristic against those obtained by the hospital's OR manager in a simulation setting with real data, we reduced the overtime from occurring 21{\%} of the time to zero, and the non-GES average waiting list's length from 71 to 58 patients, without worsening the average throughput.},

	abstract = {Operating room (OR) scheduling is a challenging combinatorial problem and hence most optimization-based OR scheduling research makes simplifying assumptions for tractability, including deterministic surgical durations, absence of dynamic emergency arrivals, and the existence of sufficient downstream resources. In this study, we use discrete event simulation to assess the performance of deterministically optimized OR schedules in a network of collaborating hospitals with shared resources, called distributed OR scheduling (DORS), in the face of uncertain surgical durations, emergency arrivals, and limited downstream resources. We quantify the individual and combined disruptive impact of these stochastic factors on the DORS schedule, using real data obtained from the University Health Network (UHN) in Toronto, Canada. We show that the schedule constructed by DORS results in higher OR utilization and lower average surgery cost compared to the simulated current UHN schedule.},

Given that Answer Set Programming (ASP) has been recently employed for solving real-life scheduling and planning problems, in this paper we first present an off-line solution based on ASP for solving the ORS problem. Then, we present techniques for re-scheduling on-line in case the off-line schedule can not be fully applied. Results of an experimental analysis conducted on benchmarks with realistic sizes and parameters show that ASP is a suitable solving methodology also for the ORS problem. This analysis has been performed with a web framework for managing ORS problems via ASP that allows a user to insert the main parameters of the problem, solve a specific instance, and show results graphically in real-time.},

With a discrete-event model we simulate how different management polices affect different performance metrics such as patient waiting time, cancellations and the utilization of OR time. The experiments show that the performance of the operating room department can be improved significantly by applying a different policy in reserving OR-capacity for emergency cases together with a policy to increase staff in stand-by. Moreover, the developed simulation model provides estimates for a what-if situation related to the prognosis of an increasing number of hip-joint replacements.},

@article{x192,
	abstract = {Operating Room (OR) management has been among the mainstream of hospital management research, as ORs are commonly considered as one of the most critical and expensive resources. The complicated connection and interplay between ORs and their upstream and downstream units has recently attracted research attention to focus more on allocating medical resources efficiently for the sake of a balanced coordination. As a critical step, surgical scheduling in the presence of uncertain surgery durations is pivotal but rather challenging since a patient cannot be hospitalized if a recovery bed will not be available to accommodate the admission. To tackle the challenge, we propose an overflow strategy that allows patients to be assigned to an undesignated department if the designated one is full. It has been proved that overflow strategy can successfully alleviate the imbalance of capacity utilization. However, some studies indicate that implementation of the overflow strategy exacerbates the readmission rate as well as the length of stay (LOS). To rigorously examine the overflow strategy and explore its optimal solution, we propose a Fuzzy model for surgical scheduling by explicitly considering downstream shortage, as well as the uncertainty of surgery duration and patient LOS. To solve the Fuzzy model, a hybrid algorithm (so-called GA-P) is developed, stemming from Genetic Algorithm (GA). Extensive numerical results demonstrate the plausible efficiency of the GA-P algorithm, especially for large-scale scheduling problems (e.g., comprehensive hospitals). Additionally, it is shown that the overflow cost plays a critical role in determining the efficiency of the overflow strategy; viz., benefits from the overflow strategy can be reduced as the overflow cost increases, and eventually almost vanishes when the cost becomes sufficiently large. Finally, the Fuzzy model is tested to be effective in terms of simplicity and reliability, yet without cannibalizing the patient admission rate.},

The probability distributions of random parameters are assumed to be ambiguous, and only the mean values and ranges are known. We propose a distributionally robust elective surgery scheduling (DRESS) model that seeks optimal surgery scheduling decisions to minimize the cost of performing and postponing surgeries and the worst-case expected costs associated with overtime and idle time of ORs and lack of ICU capacity (which causes premature discharges or transfers). We evaluate the worst-case over a family of distributions characterized by the known mean values and ranges of random parameters. We leverage the separability of DRESS formulation in deriving an exact mixed-integer nonlinear programming reformulation. We linearize and derive a family of symmetry breaking inequalities to improve the solvability of the reformulation using an adapted column-and-constraint generation algorithm. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments that demonstrate the superior performance of our DR approach as compared to the stochastic programming approach, and provide insights into DRESS.},

Reduced turnover time typically leads to increased surgeon utilization and increased patient throughput. Our main contribution is an optimization model for generating operating room schedules in a surgery department, where the pre-procedure of a surgical case is allowed to overlap with the procedure and post-procedure activities of an ongoing surgical case assigned to the same operating room. In addition, we present a computational experiment, where we create and compare 1-day schedules for a surgery department consisting of three operating rooms. The results of the experiment clearly show the potential of the idea of allowing overlapping surgical activities. This feature allows for significantly improved schedules compared to when no overlaps are allowed. The experiment also verifies the correctness of the optimization model.},

Using this model, we can determine the allocation of resources including operating rooms, surgeons, and assistant surgeons to surgeries, moreover the sequence of surgeries within operating rooms and the start time of them. The main features of the model will include the chronologic curriculum plan for training residents and the real-life constraints to be observed in teaching hospitals. The proposed model is evaluated against some real-life problems, by comparing the schedule obtained from the model and the one currently developed by the hospital staff. Numerical results indicate the efficiency of the proposed model compared to the real-life hospital scheduling, and the gap evaluations for the instances show that the results are generally satisfactory.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to design a weekly surgery schedule in an operating theatre where time blocks are reserved for surgeons rather than specialities. Both operating rooms and places in the recovery room are assumed to be multifunctional, and the objectives are to maximise the utilisation of the operating rooms, to minimise the overtime cost in the operating theatre, and to minimise the unexpected idle time between surgical cases. This weekly operating theatre planning and scheduling problem is solved in two phases. First, the planning problem is solved to give the date of surgery for each patient, allowing for the availability of operating rooms and surgeons. Then a daily scheduling problem is devised to determine the sequence of operations in each operating room in each day, taking into account the availability of recovery beds. The planning problem is described as a set-partitioning integer-programming model and is solved by a column-generation-based heuristic (CGBH) procedure. The daily scheduling problem, based on the results obtained in the planning phase, is treated as a two-stage hybrid flow-shop problem and solved by a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA). Our results are compared with several actual surgery schedules in a Belgian university hospital, where time blocks have been assigned to either specific surgeons or specialities several months in advance. According to the comparison results, surgery schedules obtained by the proposed method have less idle time between surgical cases, much higher utilisation of operating rooms and produce less overtime.},

The application and utilization of appropriate methods can enhance the number of patients treated, improve patients'satisfaction, reduce healthcare costs, and lower morbidity and mortality rates which are often associated with poor healthcare facilities, overcrowding, and low availability of healthcare professionals. Modeling the length of stay (LOS) of patients in healthcare systems is a challenge that must be addressed for sound decision-making regarding capacity planning and resource allocation. This paper presents a machine learning (ML) framework for predicting a patient's LOS within the ED. A study of the services in the ED of a tertiary healthcare facility in Uyo, Nigeria was conducted to gain insights into its operational procedures and evaluate the impact of certain parameters on LOS. Then, a computer simulation of the system was performed in R programming language using data obtained from records in the hospital. Finally, the performance of four ML classifiers involved in patients'LOS prediction: Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were evaluated and results indicate that SVM outperforms others with the highest coefficient of determination (R2) score of 0.986984 and least mean square error (MSE) value of 0.358594. The result demonstrates the capability of ML techniques to effectively assess the performance of healthcare systems and accurately predict patients'LOS to mitigate the low physician-patient ratio and improve throughput.},

	abstract = {This article studies the stochastic Operating Room (OR) scheduling problem integrated with a Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), the overall problem is called the Operating Theater Room (OTR) problem. Due to the inherent uncertainty in surgery duration and its consecutive PACU time, the completion time of a patient should be modeled as the sum of a number of random variables. Some researchers have proposed the use of the normal distribution for its well-known additive property, but there are questions regarding its fitting adequacy to real OTR data, which tends to be asymmetric with a long tail. We propose to estimate the surgery and PACU times with the family of Continuous PHase-type (CPH) distributions, which provides both fitting adequacy and additive property. We first compute the completion time of each patient analytically and compare the results with normal and lognormal distributions on a series of real OTR datasets. Then, we develop a search algorithm embedding a constructive heuristic and a meta-heuristic algorithm as a sequence generator engine for the patients, and apply the CPH distribution as a chance constraint to eventually find the schedule of each sequence in the OTR problem. The best algorithm among several tested constructive heuristic algorithms is used as the neighborhood structure of meta-heuristic algorithms. We finally construct a numerical example of OTR problem to illustrate the application of the proposed algorithm.},

	abstract = {Among the many challenges involved in efficient healthcare resource planning, the Patient Admission Scheduling Problem is of particular significance, impacting organizational decisions at all planning levels. The problem of scheduling patient admissions involves assigning patients to beds over a given time horizon so as to maximize treatment efficiency, patient comfort and hospital utilization, while satisfying all necessary medical constraints and taking into consideration patient preferences as much as possible. A number of different variants of the Patient Admission Scheduling Problem exist at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels. In this paper, we consider a static offline operational level variant for which we propose a comprehensive mixed integer programming formulation and advance an exact solution method. We generate new best found solutions for 9 out of 13 benchmark instances from a publicly available repository. Additionally, we prove the optimality of two best known solutions reported in the literature.},

	abstract = {In this research, we studied operating room scheduling problem of assigning a set of surgeries to several multifunctional operating rooms. The objectives are to maximize the utilization of the operating rooms, to minimize the overtime-operating cost, and to minimize the wasting cost for the unused time. To begin with, a revised mathematical model is constructed to assign surgeries to operating rooms within one week. Then, we proposed four easy-to-implement heuristics that can guarantee to find feasible solutions for the studied problem efficiently. Furthermore, we presented four local search procedures that can improve a given solution significantly. Finally, a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) that incorporated with initial solutions, local search procedures and elite search procedure is applied to the studied problem. Computational results show that for small problem instances, the HGA can find near optimal solutions efficiently while for large problem instances, the HGA performs significantly better than the four proposed heuristics. We concluded that surgery schedules obtained by using HGA has less wasting cost for the unused time, much higher utilization of operating rooms, and produce less overtime-operating cost.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the Advance Scheduling Problem, in which candidate patients from the patients'waiting list have to be selected and allocated to the available operating room blocks in a short-term schedule, taking into consideration a number of restrictions. We determine the available blocks by a modified block scheduling strategy. We propose multiple objectives, including minimization of the patients waiting time, tardiness, cancellation, block overtime, and the number of surgery days of each surgeon within the planning horizon. In our problem, uncertainty is taken into account via stochastic surgery durations, but also a deterministic version is considered for reasons of comparison. We approach the problem with different formulations of two-stage stochastic programming and two-stage chance-constrained stochastic programming. We solve the proposed models through the sample average approximation (SAA) method and Benders decomposition technique. Based on examining the approaches on real hospital data, we illustrate that deterministic solutions do not fit properly in the stochastic environment for this problem. We also demonstrate that using a chance-constrained approach decreases the considerable variation between the deterministic and stochastic solution. Finally, we show that the SAA method and Benders decomposition algorithm can generate effective solutions in a relatively reasonable computational time in medium-sized problems.},

@article{x207,
	abstract = {In this paper we investigate the planning of operating rooms at Rigshospitalet, a large Danish hospital. Each operation must be assigned to a specific operating room and also be scheduled for a specific time while taking into account clinical guidelines. Both elective and emergency operations are included, such that the elective operations are planned while still taking potential emergency operations into consideration. Furthermore, the duration of each operation is uncertain. The aim is to construct robust operating room schedules that minimise overtime work and release unused capacity. Due to the uncertainty associated with arrival of emergency patients and also the duration of each operation, a deterministic model is not suitable for this problem. Therefore, we develop a stochastic model where operation duration can vary and where the arrivals of emergency patients are unknown. The stochastic model is computationally heavy, so two mixed integer programming based heuristics denoted 2-Step Relax-and-Fix and All Open Relax-and-Fix are developed to solve the problem. The computational study is based on an extensive dataset compromising 304 days. The heuristics give good results with half of the operating rooms having less than 8 min of overtime work. To test the robustness of the solutions we carry out a simulated implementation of the operation plans. The simulation shows that the heuristic solutions are fairly robust. In general, results show a clear potential for implementing the method for planning and scheduling of operating rooms at Rigshospitalet.},

	abstract = {The Patient Admission Scheduling (PAS) problem is a combinatorial optimization problem where elective patients are automatically assigned to beds for the duration of their stay considering not only the medical necessity but also the patient preferences. Due to its combinatorial nature, solving the previously published problem instances to optimality is a difficult task. In this paper, we present two Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) based heuristics namely Fix-and-Relax (F\&R) and Fix-and-Optimize (F\&O) where PAS problem instances are decomposed into sub-problems and then the sub-problems are optimized. Our approach uses patient decomposition considering patient length-of-Stay (LoS), room preference, admission date, specialism choice, and age, as well as time decomposition considering different optimization window sizes. Quick solutions generated by F\&R heuristic are used as an input to the F\&O heuristic and are improved in an iterative nature. Main goal of the study is to provide high quality solutions in shorter run times. Computational findings show that the proposed heuristics provide promising results towards the solution of the problem in faster CPU times than the previously reported values where less than 15 percent gap from the best known solutions is achieved for most of the test instances, and as low as 5 percent gap for some of the sample data.},

	abstract = {This work is part of an ongoing project with a Portuguese public hospital, where the elective surgeries scheduling problem is studied. The administration of the hospital aims to achieve the targets set by the Portuguese Ministry of Health for surgical production and to ensure a surgical service with a high level of efficiency. However, hospitals do not have an elective surgeries scheduling system, so the surgeries are unsystematically scheduled and without respecting equity criteria, thus disregarding the Ministry's goals. Three versions of the problem are considered and local search heuristics are developed in order to quickly find good solutions for each version of the problem. The heuristics select patients from a long waiting list for surgery to be scheduled in each week, and define a room, a day and a shift for each selected surgery according to one of three different perspectives of the problem. The heuristics developed are tested in real instances and the values of the solutions are compared with the values of the solutions obtained using mixed integer linear programming models. The solutions obtained by the heuristics are of very good quality and the computational time required is generally quite low, even considering the instances with more surgeries in the waiting list. In addition, a user-friendly interface is created for the hospital, which reads all the relevant data and proposes a weekly surgical schedule in a systematic manner.},

With surgery sequences predetermined in each OR, a Discrete-Event Dynamic System (DEDS) is devised for the problem. A DEDS-based stochastic optimization model is formulated in order to minimize the cost incurred from patient waiting time, OR idle time, OR blocking time, OR overtime, and PACU overtime. A sample gradient-based algorithm is proposed for the sample average approximation of our formulation. Numerical experiments suggest that the proposed method identifies near-optimal solutions and outperforms previous methods. We also show that considerable cost savings (11.8{\%} on average) are possible in hospitals where PACU beds are a constraint.},

A meta-heuristic approach integrating Pareto sets and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is proposed to solve such multi-objective OR scheduling optimization problem. The Pareto sets construction and the modified ant graph model is introduced and two types of pheromone setting and updating strategies are compared to determine a more efficient multi-objective OR scheduling algorithm. The scheduling results by four different approaches, i.e. the simulation, the ACO with single objective of makespan (ACO-SO), the ACO with multi-objective by weighted sum method (ACO-weighted-sum), and the hybrid Pareto set-ACO with multi-objectives (PSACO-MO) are compared. The test case in the literature, which is from MD Anderson Cancer Center, is also used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The computational results show that the PSACO-MO achieves good results in shortening makespan, reducing nurses'overtime and balancing resources'utilization in general.},

Their scheduling is difficult because, in addition to the surgical room itself, each surgery requires a particular combination of human resources, as well as different pieces of equipment and materials. Furthermore, after each surgery, a post-anesthesia bed is required for the patient to recover. Finally, in addition to planned surgeries, the scheduling must be made in such a way as to accommodate the emergency surgeries that may arrive during each day, which must be attended within a limited time. We address the surgery scheduling problem considering simultaneously, for the first time, the operating rooms, the post anesthesia recovery, the resources required by the surgery and the possible arrival of emergency surgeries. We propose an integer linear programming model that allows finding optimal solutions for small size instances, we transform it to use constraint programming, and develop a metaheuristic based on a genetic algorithm and a constructive heuristic, that solves larger size instances. Finally, we present numerical experiments.},

	abstract = {In hospitals, the operating room (OR) is a particularly expensive facility and thus efficient scheduling is imperative. This can be greatly supported by using advanced methods that are discussed in the academic literature. In order to help researchers and practitioners to select new relevant articles, we classify the recent OR planning and scheduling literature into tables regarding patient type, used performance measures, decisions made, OR up- and downstream facilities, uncertainty, research methodology and testing phase. Based on these classifications, we identify trends and promising topics. Additionally, we recognize three common pitfalls that hamper the adoption of research results by stakeholders: the lack of a clear choice of authors on whether to target researchers (contributing advanced methods) or practitioners (providing managerial insights), the use of ill-fitted performance measures in models and the failure to understandably report on the hospital setting and method-related assumptions. We provide specific guidelines that help to avoid these pitfalls. First, we show how to build up an article based on the choice of the target group (i.e., researchers or practitioners). Making a clear distinction between target groups impacts the problem setting, the research task, the reported findings, and the conclusions. Second, we discuss points that need to be considered by researchers when deciding on the used performance measures. Third, we list the assumptions that need to be included in articles in order to enable readers to decide whether the presented research is relevant to them.},

	abstract = {In this work we consider the problem of selecting a set of patients among a given waiting list of elective patients and assigning them to a set of available operating room blocks. We assume a block scheduling strategy in which the number and the length of available blocks are given. As each block is related to a specific day, by assigning a patient to a block his/her surgery date is fixed, as well. Each patient is characterized by a recommended maximum waiting time and an uncertain surgery duration. In practical applications, new patients enter the waiting list continuously. Patient selection and assignment is performed by surgery departments on a short-term, usually a week, regular base. We propose a so-called rolling horizon approach for the patient selection and assignment. At each iteration short-term patient assignment is decided. However, in a look-ahead perspective, a longer planning horizon is considered when looking for the patient selection. The mid-term assignment over the next {\$}{\$}n{\$}{\$}weeks is generated by solving an ILP problem, minimizing a penalty function based on total waiting time and tardiness of patients. The approach is iteratively applied by shifting ahead the mid-term planning horizon. When applying the first week solution, unpredictable extensions of surgeries may disrupt the schedule. Such disruptions are recovered in the next iteration: the mid-term solution is rescheduled limiting the number of variations from the previously computed plan. Besides, the approach allows to deal with new patient arrivals. To keep limited the number of disruptions due to uncertain surgery duration, we propose also a robust formulation of the ILP problem. The deterministic and the robust formulation based frameworks are compared over a set of instances, including different stochastic realization of surgery times.},

@article{x216,
	abstract = {The term `surgery scheduling'is used to describe a variety of strategic, tactical and operational scheduling problems, many of which are critical to the quality of treatment and to the efficient use of hospital resources. We consider operational surgery scheduling problems. The exact problem formulation varies substantially between hospitals or, even, hospital departments. In addition, the level of detail varies between different planning situations, ranging from long term patient admission planning to the very detailed scheduling of a particular day׳s surgeries. This diversity makes it difficult to design general scheduling methods and software solutions that can be applied without extensive customisation for each application. We approach this challenge by proposing a new generalised model for surgery scheduling problems. We show how this model extends the multi-project, multi-mode resource constrained project scheduling problem with generalised time constraints, including some extensions that to our knowledge have not been previously studied. Furthermore, we present a search method for solving the proposed model. The algorithm uses on-line learning to balance computational loads between a construction and an improvement method, both working on high level solution representations. An adapted schedule generation scheme is used to map these to concrete schedules. We perform computational experiments using realistic problem instances from three surgery scheduling planning situations at a medium sized Norwegian hospital; day scheduling, week scheduling and admission planning. The results show that the algorithm performs well across these quite different problems without any off-line customisation or parameter tuning.},

The main novelty is that we consider constraints on the utilisation of operating rooms for patients requiring a surgery. In addition, we propose a more elaborate model that includes a flexible planning horizon, a complex notion of patient delay, and new components of the objective function. We design a solution approach based on local search, which explores the search space using a composite neighbourhood. In addition, we develop an instance generator that uses real-world data and statistical distributions so as to synthesise realistic and challenging case studies, which are made available on the web along with our solutions and the validator.

	abstract = {This study is devoted to the appointment scheduling (AS) for a sequence of surgeries with random durations served by multiple operating rooms (Multi-OR). Surgeries are assigned to ORs dynamically on a first-come, first-serve (FCFS) basis. It materially differs from past literature in the sense that dynamic assignments are proactively anticipated in the determination of appointment times. A discrete-event framework is proposed to model the execution of the surgery schedule and to evaluate the sample path gradient of a total cost incurred by surgeon waiting, OR idling, and OR overtime. The sample path cost function is shown to be unimodal, Lipchitz-continuous, and differentiable w.p.1 and the expected cost function continuously differentiable. A stochastic approximation algorithm based on unbiased gradient estimators is proposed and extensive numerical experiments suggest that it converges to a global optimum. A series of numerical experiments is performed to show the significant benefits of the Multi-OR setting and properties of the optimal solution with respect to various system parameters such as cost structure and numbers of surgeries and ORs.},

	abstract = {There is evidence in the literature that most surgeries in hospitals are performed by a team composed of two surgeons, and that their experience largely influences the surgery duration. However, to the best our knowledge, only one contribution has addressed the operating room planning and scheduling problem with surgical teams, but in such case surgery durations did not depend on the experience of surgeons. In this paper we address an integrated operating room planning and scheduling problem with surgical teams composed by one or two surgeons where surgery durations depend on their experience and skills. We propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to optimally solve this problem. Given the high computation requirements of our MILP model, we also propose an iterative constructive method. In order to evaluate the performance of both exact and approximate methods, an extensive test bed is generated. The computational experience shows that the proposed algorithm is able to find feasible solution for all problems requiring shorter CPU time and average relative percentage deviation than the MILP model. Finally, the robustness of the so-obtained surgical schedules is analyzed using simulation.},

	abstract = {Operating room surgery scheduling deals with determining operation start times of surgeries on hand and allocating the required resources to the scheduled surgeries, considering several constraints to ensure a complete surgery flow, the resource availability, and specialties and qualifications of human resources. This task plays a crucial role in providing timely treatments for the patients while ensuring the balance in the hospital's resource utilization. By observing similarities between operating room surgery scheduling and a multi-resource constraint flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP) in manufacturing, this article proposes an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) approach to efficiently solve such surgery scheduling problems based on the knowledge gained in FJSSP. Numerical experiments are performed on five surgery test cases with different problem sizes and resource availability. The performance of the ACO algorithm was compared against schedules generated by a discrete event system simulation model built in SIMIO on five test cases. The results showed a superior performance of ACO in makespan, overtime, and the variation coefficient of working time.},

	abstract = {Given a surgery department comprising several specialties that share a fixed number of operating rooms and post-surgery beds, we study the joint operating room (OR) planning and advanced scheduling problem. More specifically, we consider the problem of determining, over a one week planning horizon, the allocation of OR time blocks to specialties together with the subsets of patients to be scheduled within each time block. The aim of this paper is to extend and generalize existing approaches for the joint OR planning and scheduling problem. First, by allowing schedules that include patients requiring weekend stay beds which was not the case previously. Second, by tackling simultaneously both the OR planning and patient scheduling decision levels, instead of taking them into account in successive phases. To achieve this, we exploit the inherent hierarchy between the two decision levels, i.e.,the fact that the assignment decisions of OR time blocks to surgical specialties directly affect those regarding the scheduling of patients, but not the reverse. The objective function used in this study is an extension of an existing one. It seeks to optimize both patient utility (by reducing waiting time costs) and hospital utility (by reducing production costs measured in terms of the number of weekend stay beds required by the surgery planning). 0--1 linear programming formulations exploiting the stated hierarchy are proposed and used to derive a formal proof that the problem is NP-hard. A two level metaheuristic is then developed for solving the problem and its effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments carried out on a large set of instances based on real data.},

By virtue of its huge consumption of human and material resources, the operating theatre is one of the most important sources of expenses of the hospitals. A less costly organization of the operating rooms calls for a more rational use of the resources and a more refined planning of the surgical units. In addition to these considerations, we are concerned about the well-being of the medical staff. We integrate this human factor into the optimization procedure by stressing the human resources'availabilities in the design of the schedules. This planning process is typically decomposed in two sequential phases: a planning stage followed by a scheduling stage. Due to this decomposition the resulting solutions may turn out to be sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose a formulation that includes both the planning and scheduling of the surgical operations. We also propose a heuristic solution procedure based on genetic algorithms to counter the large running times inherent in tackling this kind of hard optimization problem.},

A stochastic dynamic programming model is formulated to address this problem. A structural analysis of the proposed model is conducted to understand the properties of an optimal schedule policy. Based on the structural analysis, bounds on feasible actions are incorporated into a value iteration algorithm, and a brief computation experiment shows the improvement in computational efficiency. Numerical examples show that the consideration of patient priority results in significant differences in surgery schedules from the schedule that ignores the patient priority.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to design a weekly surgery schedule in an operating theatre where time blocks are reserved for surgeons rather than specialities. Both operating rooms and places in the recovery room are assumed to be multifunctional, and the objectives are to maximise the utilisation of the operating rooms, to minimise the overtime cost in the operating theatre, and to minimise the unexpected idle time between surgical cases. This weekly operating theatre planning and scheduling problem is solved in two phases. First, the planning problem is solved to give the date of surgery for each patient, allowing for the availability of operating rooms and surgeons. Then a daily scheduling problem is devised to determine the sequence of operations in each operating room in each day, taking into account the availability of recovery beds. The planning problem is described as a set-partitioning integer-programming model and is solved by a column-generation-based heuristic (CGBH) procedure. The daily scheduling problem, based on the results obtained in the planning phase, is treated as a two-stage hybrid flow-shop problem and solved by a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA). Our results are compared with several actual surgery schedules in a Belgian university hospital, where time blocks have been assigned to either specific surgeons or specialities several months in advance. According to the comparison results, surgery schedules obtained by the proposed method have less idle time between surgical cases, much higher utilisation of operating rooms and produce less overtime.},

Firstly, we formulate this problem as an integer problem and then reformulate the integer program by using Dantzig--Wolf decomposition as a set partitioning problem. Based on this set partitioning formulation, a so-called branch-and-price exact solution algorithm, combining Branch-and-Bound procedure with column generation (CG) method, is designed for the proposed problem where each node is the linear relaxation problem of a set partitioning problem. This linear relaxation problem is solved by a CG approach in which each column represents a plan for one operating room and is generated by solving a sub-problem (SP) of single operating room planning problem. The computational results indicate that the decomposition approach is promising and capable of solving large problems.},

This research was performed in collaboration with the Erasmus MC, a large academic hospital in the Netherlands, which has also provided historical data for the experiments. We propose various constructive heuristics and local search methods that use statistical information on surgery durations to exploit the portfolio effect, and thereby to minimize the required slack. We demonstrate that our approach frees a lot of operating room capacity, which may be used to perform additional surgeries.

	abstract = {The Master Surgery Scheduling Problem (MSSP) allocates operating theatre time to surgery groups such as medical specialities or surgeons, which is essential for daily operational planners. Many researchers have highlighted issues in the optimization of surgical scheduling problems. However, most recent reviews limited the issues at the operational level and excluded the problem characteristics such as surgery group type and schedule cyclicity. This study aims to review the state-of-the-art of MSSP and identify new trends in optimization strategies (problem characteristics and objective function), uncertainty scheduling factors (types and approaches), and solution and evaluation methods. These aspects are the key components in developing an effective MSSP optimization model. This paper reviews articles published between 2000 and 2021 that addressed the MSSP, concentrating on papers between 2016 and 2021. We underlined the popularity of medical specialities as the surgery group, one-week horizon length, a cyclic schedule, multi-objective optimization and evaluation by benchmarking. The analysis shows that surgery duration is the most prominent uncertainty type, whereas strategies for handling this are stochastic programming, robust optimization, and fuzzy programming. We highlighted the role of heuristic approaches in addressing the MSSP's computational complexity. This review's trends, challenges, and potential solutions are essential for future researchers in developing optimization models for MSSP.},

Radiotherapy devices are among the most valuable and specialized equipment categories and carry enormous treatment loads. In this study, a novel method is proposed to improve the efficiency of a radiotherapy device (linac). Although scheduling management with accurate prediction of the entire treatment time included in each appointment, arrange a reasonable time duration for appointments and save time between patient shifts effectively. Tasks belonging to the treatment and non-treatment groups can be assigned more flexibly based on the availability of time. Material and methods Data from 1665 patients, including patient positioning time (PT) and treatment time (TT), were collected in collaboration with the Radiotherapy Center of the Department of Oncology at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University from November 2020 to August 2021. The features related to PT and TT were extracted and used to train the machine learning-based model to predict PT and TT in independent patients. The prediction results were subsequently applied to a minute-based scheduling tool. Conclusion Artificial intelligence is a promising approach to solve abstract problems with a specialized knowledge background. The results of this study show encouraging prediction outcomes in relation to effective scheduling management and could improve the efficiency of the linac. This successful trial broadens the meaning of medical data and potential future research directions in radiotherapy.},

The tool is user-friendly and intuitive, automates tasks, provides instant reporting, and is extensible. It has been developed as an Excel Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) due to its perceived ease of deployment, ease of use, Office's vast installed userbase, and extensive legacy in business. The methodology developed in this article bridges the gap between mathematical theory and practice, which our inference suggests, has restricted the uptake and or development of advanced hospital planning tools and software. To the best of our knowledge, no personal decision support tool (PDST) has yet been created and installed within any existing hospital IT systems, to perform the aforementioned tasks. This article demonstrates that the development of a PDST for hospitals is viable and that optimization methods can be embedded quite simply at no cost. The results of extensive development and testing indicate that HOPLITE can automate many nuanced tasks. Furthermore, there are few limitations and only minor scalability issues with the application of free to use optimization software. The functionality that HOPLITE provides may make it easier to calibrate hospitals strategically and/or tactically to demands. It may give hospitals more control over their case-mix and their resources, helping them to operate more proactively and more efficiently.},

Most previous studies only consider a single type of emergency resource, which may result in inefficient coordination or bottlenecks between various types of resources. This paper addresses the combined problem of ambulance dispatching and operating room scheduling during an MCI. Specifically, we consider the limited ambulances and emergency operating rooms as reusable resources, more accurately reflecting reality than previous research. A novel mixed integer programming model aims to maximize the number of patients who can undergo surgery before their critical surgery time. A hybrid algorithm combining the Tabu Search and an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search with five new specific removal operators is proposed for solving large-scale instances. The model is solved by Gurobi, and the results are compared with the proposed TS-ALNS. On small-scale instances, TS-ALNS is comparable to Gurobi, while on large-scale instances, it outperforms other meta-heuristics, including the Tabu search algorithm, the adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm, the simulated annealing algorithm, and the variable neighborhood search algorithm. In addition, the utilization and effectiveness of the five proposed removal operators are analyzed.},

To address these issues, this study focuses on 13 districts and counties in Wuhan, China. The importance of each research area is analyzed using the improved PageRank and TOPSIS algorithms to determine the optimal site selection plan. Additionally, a particle swarm algorithm is used to construct an emergency material dispatching model that targets both distribution and site selection costs to solve the multi-distribution center dispatching problem. The results suggest that constructing 10 distribution centers can satisfy the demand for epidemic prevention and control in Wuhan city while saving costs associated with site selection and material distribution. Compared to the previous optimal solution, the distribution and site selection costs under the optimal solution decreased by 27.9% and 17.82%, respectively. This approach can serve as a basis for dispatching emergency materials during public health emergencies.},

This study investigates the impact of increased access to information and consumer choices on market efficiency and matching in a market that experiences resource misallocation and rationing. We examine the introduction of a mobile-phone-based outpatient appointment app that provides real-time information on hospital crowdedness and enables limited advance appointment booking. Our study provides robust evidence that the app's introduction significantly enhances hospital efficiency by facilitating patient sorting over time, across providers, and according to the patient's medical needs. This includes prompting patients with mild conditions to utilize primary care facilities and enabling acute care hospitals to receive more patients with severe conditions. The improved sorting leads to better health outcomes, such as fewer revisits, lower spending, and better adherence to prescription guidelines. Our findings indicate that the adoption of the app generates significant welfare gains and is financially viable. The study offers valuable insights for hospital managers, policy-makers, and academics on the potential of lightweight, mobile technology innovations to enhance efficiency in the healthcare market.},

	abstract = {Purpose Waiting time, as an important predictor of queue abandonment and patient satisfaction, is important for resource utilization and patient experience management. Medical institutions have given top priority to reforming the appointment system for many years; however, whether the increased information transparency brought about by the appointment scheduling mechanism could improve patient waiting time is not well understood. In this study, the authors examine the effects of information transparency in reducing patient waiting time from an uncertainty perspective. Design/methodology/approach Leveraging a quasi-natural experiment in a tertiary academic hospital, the authors analyze over one million observational patient visit records and design the propensity score matching plus the difference in difference (PSM-DID) model and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to address this issue. Findings The authors confirm that, on average, improved information transparency significantly reduces the waiting time for patients by approximately 6.43 min, a 4.90{\%} reduction. The authors identify three types of uncertainties (resource, process and outcome uncertainty) in the patient visit process that affect patients' waiting time. Moreover, information transparency moderates the relationship between three sources of uncertainties and waiting time. Originality/value The authors'work not only provides important theoretical explanations for the patient-level factors of in-clinic waiting time and the reasons for information technology (IT)-enabled appointment scheduling by time slot (ITASS) to shorten patient waiting time and improve patient experience but also provides potential solutions for further exploration of measures to reduce patient waiting time.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of allowing patient recovery in the operating room when no recovery bed is available. Three types of identical resources are considered: transporters, operating rooms and recovery beds. A fixed number of patients must be planned over a term horizon, usually one or two weeks. The surgery process is modelled as follows: each patient is transported from the ward to the operating theatre. Then the patient visits an operating room for surgery operation and is transferred to the recovery room. If no recovery bed is available, the patient wakes up in the operating room until a bed becomes available. The operating room needs to be cleaned after the patient's departure, before starting another operation. Finally, the patient is transported back to the ward after his recovery. We consider several criteria based on patients'completion times. We propose a Lagrangian relaxation-based method to solve this operating theatre scheduling problem. The efficiency of this method is then validated by numerical experiments. A comprehensive numerical experiment is then performed to quantify the benefit of allowing patient recovery in operating rooms. We show that the benefit is high when the workload of the recovery beds is high.},

	n2 = {Increasing population across all age groups has contributed to the increasing demand for health care especially those that require surgeries, thus putting more pressure on hospitals. The inability to provide adequate and efficient treatment as a result of resource constraints causes patients to wait longer for treatment. Waiting for treatment due to unavailability of an operating theatre can result in both deteriorating health and inconvenience. It is even more frustrating when the scheduled operation is cancelled because some slots is used for emergency patients or the scheduled operations are longer that planned. When such situation occurs, some patients need to be rescheduled. To resolve this problem, an operating theatre scheduling for emergency and regular patients is considered. We consider the single operating theatre problem across multiple days together with the multiple operating theatres problem on a single day. The aim is to minimise the cost incurred when patients need to be rescheduled as well as ensure minimal delay and rescheduling. We develop a model and design an algorithm to schedule operations for patients, taking into account their urgency. Patients' urgency depends on their respective situation and changes depend on several factors. Tackling the problem of scheduling single operating theatre, we use a heuristic method to provide a starting solution before applying local search and simulating annealing. The schedule is updated daily to take into account variations from planned durations and the arrival of emergency patients. The rescheduling of patients may be necessary. We consider the priority of patients and ensure that top priority patients be considered first in the scheduling and less important patients can be rescheduled if necessary. Under the local search technique, we swap every pair of patients if they satisfy the conditions imposed. After the patients are swapped, we check the total cost of the swap and compare it with the current cost. If the new total cost is less than the current cost, the swap will be finalised. We then consider the next patient until all remaining patients in the list are accounted for and we come out with the new list of schedule. Continuing from that, we utilise simulating annealing technique where we calculate the difference of the total cost (total new cost - total current cost), Δ between a pair of patients that we plan to swap. With this approach, as opposed to the local search procedure, even when the di↵erence of the total cost is positive, swapping might still take place but only with a certain probability. Besides single operating theatre, we also consider the scheduling of multiple operation theatres in a single day. Rather than using the algorithm technique, we propose an integer programming model, the Zero-One Programming model and develop an algorithm that utilises the model in scheduling multiple parallel OTs. If a surgery runs longer that expected or an emergency patient arrived into the system, patients can be moved between the available OTs to ensure that surgeries can still be performed; or if the model decides it is better to reschedule therefore the patients will be rescheduled to the next day. In order to test the efficiency of our models and look at the compatibility of the models with our algorithm, data are generated with different parameters to see if our proposed models have the ability to lower cost as well as prevent delays and rescheduling. Moreover, we check the computational time of our algorithm to ascertain whether it can provide solutions within a short amount of time. Overall, our models show improvement in reducing cost and minimising delay and rescheduling.},

Our approaches consist of novel uni-level and bi-level branch-and-check algorithms that solve the problem using a hybridization of integer programming and constraint programming. We demonstrate that our approaches outperform an existing time-indexed integer programming model, yielding significant improvements on solution quality. Our methods are competitive with an existing genetic algorithm while providing provable bounds on solution quality. We conduct an investigation into the impact of time discretization on our algorithms, illustrating that our decompositions, unlike the previously proposed integer programming approach, are much less sensitive to time discretization and produce more accurate solutions as a result. Finally, we introduce and investigate benchmark instances with a more diverse case mix. Overall, we conclude that our decompositions are the most appropriate approaches for this multi-level operating room planning and scheduling problem.},

	abstract = {We model and solve an order acceptance and scheduling problem in an identical parallel machine setting. The goal is to maximize profit by making four decisions: (i) accept or reject an order, (ii) assign accepted orders to identical parallel machines, (iii) sequence accepted orders, and (iv) schedule order starting times. First, we develop a mixed-integer model that simultaneously optimizes the above four decisions. We enhance the model with pre-processing techniques, valid inequalities, and dominance rules. Second, we show that the model has a special structure that allows us to develop both classical and combinatorial Benders decomposition. We thus develop a classical Benders decomposition approach and two combinatorial Benders variants: (i) logic-based Benders decomposition and (ii) Branch-Relax-and-Check (BRC). The BRC, as the primary contribution of this paper, extends the literature in three ways: (1) it incorporates novel sequencing sub-problem relaxations that expedite convergence, (2) it employs a novel cutting-plane partitioning procedure that allows these sub-problem relaxations to be separately optimized outside the master problem, and (3) it uses temporary Benders cuts that communicate sub-problem relaxation solutions to the master problem. Third, we demonstrate that the BRC outperforms significantly other methods and finds integer feasible solutions for 100{\%} of instances, guarantees optimality in 50{\%} of instances, and achieves an average optimality gap of 3.20{\%} within our time limit.},

	abstract = {We study the balanced distributed operating room (OR) scheduling (BDORS) problem as a location-allocation model, encompassing two levels of balancing decisions: (i) daily macro imbalance among collaborating hospitals in terms of the number of allocated ORs and (ii) daily micro imbalance among open ORs in each hospital in terms of the total caseload assigned. BDORS is formulated as a novel mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) in which the macro and micro imbalance are penalized using absolute value and quadratic functions. We develop various reformulation-linearization techniques (RLTs) for the MINLP models, leading to three mathematical modelling variants: (i) a mixed-integer quadratically constrained program (MIQCP) and (ii) two mixed-integer programs (MIPs) for the absolute value penalty function and an MIQCP for the quadratic penalty function. Two novel exact techniques based on reformulation-decomposition techniques (RDTs) are developed to solve these models: a uni- and a bi-level logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD). We motivate the LBBD methods with an application to BDORS in the University Health Network (UHN), consisting of three collaborating hospitals: Toronto General Hospital, Toronto Western Hospital, and Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The uni-level LBBD method decomposes the model into a surgical suite location, OR allocation, and macro balancing master problem (MP) and micro OR balancing sub-problems (SPs) for each hospital-day. The bi-level approach uses a relaxed MP, consisting of a surgical suite location and relaxed allocation/macro balancing MP and two optimization SPs. The primary SP is formulated as a bin-packing problem to allocate patients to open operating rooms to minimize the number of ORs, while the secondary SP is the uni-level micro balancing SP. Using UHN datasets consisting of two datasets, hard MP/easy SPs and easy MP/hard SPs, we show that both LBBD approaches and both MIP models solved via Gurobi converge to  ≈2{\%} and  ≈1--2{\%} optimality gaps, on average, respectively, within 30 minutes runtime, whereas the MIQCP solved via Gurobi could not solve any instance of the UHN datasets given the same runtime. The uni- and bi-level LBBD approaches solved all instances of hard MP/easy SPs dataset to  ≈11{\%} and  ≈2{\%} optimality gaps, on average, respectively, within 30 minutes runtime, whereas MIQCP solved via Gurobi could not solve any of these instances. Additionally, we show that convergence of each LBBD varies depending on where in the decomposition the actual computational complexity lies.},

@article{x267,
	abstract = {The random arrivals of walk-in patients significantly affect the daily operations of healthcare facilities. To improve the performance of outpatient departments, this paper attempts to make an appointment schedule by considering walk-ins and the waiting time target (WTT) for appointment patients. A stochastic programming model is proposed to solve this problem with the objective of minimizing the weighted patient waiting and makespan cost. A non-decreasing waiting cost function is used to capture the WTT fulfillment of appointment patients, whereas walk-ins incur a linear waiting cost. A finite-horizon Markov Decision Process model is formulated to establish the optimal real-time scheduling policy under a given appointment schedule. The appointment schedule is determined by a two-stage stochastic programming approximation and a local search improvement. Structural properties of the optimal appointment scheduling and real-time scheduling policies are established. In particular, it is shown that appointment overbooking is allowed only at the end of the regular session, and the optimal real-time scheduling policy is an easy-to-implement threshold policy with bounded sensitivity. Numerical experiments based on real data are performed to investigate the influence of different parameters and to compare different schedules. The optimal schedule demonstrates superior performance by allowing reasonable waiting times for appointment patients depending on their WTTs. Managerial insights are also provided to hospital managers. Finally, the basic model is extended by incorporating random service times and random arrivals of appointment patients. The latter includes the random number of patients that show up for service or call for appointments, and the random arrival time (unpunctuality). Appointment overbooking strategies are shown to have different structures under some stochastic factors.},

The problem simultaneously tackles the capacity allocation of operating rooms to each specialty, assignment of operating rooms to surgeons, assignment and sequence of patients. To lower the total costs of operating rooms from both sides of patients and operating rooms, a mathematical model is proposed with objective of minimizing the patient waiting costs and operating room overtime costs. Some structural properties of the studied problem are proposed, and two heuristic algorithms are presented to solve the patient assignment problem based on these structural properties. The studied operating room scheduling problem is proved to be NP-hard, and a hybrid GWO-VNS algorithm combining Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) with Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS) is developed to obtain a good solution, where the heuristic algorithms are incorporated. Finally, computational experiments are conducted to test the efficiency, stability, and convergence speed of the proposed algorithm and compared with other mainstream algorithms. The results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the compared algorithms.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the aging population and the little availability of informal care are two of the several factors leading to an increased need for assisted living support. Hence, home healthcare (HHC) operations including a set of nurses and patients have been developed recently by both academia and health practitioners to consider elderlies'preferences willing to receive their cares at their homes instead of hospitals or retirement homes. Commonly, different services, e.g., nursing, physiotherapy, housekeeping and cleaning, for an HHC system are performed by nurses at patients'homes after scheduling and routing the nurses by decision makers. Due to the difficulty of the problem, recent studies show a great deal of interest in applying various metaheuristics and heuristics to solve this problem. To alleviate the drawbacks of previous works and make HHC more practical, this paper develops not only a new mathematical formulation considering new suppositions in this research area but also a lower bound based on Lagrangian relaxation theory has been employed. As such, three new heuristics and a hybrid constructive metaheuristic are utilized in this study to solve the proposed model. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithms is validated by the developed lower bound and also analyzed by different criteria and also the efficiency of developed formulation is probed through some sensitivity analyses.},

	abstract = {This article studies the stochastic Operating Room (OR) scheduling problem integrated with a Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), the overall problem is called the Operating Theater Room (OTR) problem. Due to the inherent uncertainty in surgery duration and its consecutive PACU time, the completion time of a patient should be modeled as the sum of a number of random variables. Some researchers have proposed the use of the normal distribution for its well-known additive property, but there are questions regarding its fitting adequacy to real OTR data, which tends to be asymmetric with a long tail. We propose to estimate the surgery and PACU times with the family of Continuous PHase-type (CPH) distributions, which provides both fitting adequacy and additive property. We first compute the completion time of each patient analytically and compare the results with normal and lognormal distributions on a series of real OTR datasets. Then, we develop a search algorithm embedding a constructive heuristic and a meta-heuristic algorithm as a sequence generator engine for the patients, and apply the CPH distribution as a chance constraint to eventually find the schedule of each sequence in the OTR problem. The best algorithm among several tested constructive heuristic algorithms is used as the neighborhood structure of meta-heuristic algorithms. We finally construct a numerical example of OTR problem to illustrate the application of the proposed algorithm.},

	abstract = {Surgery groups are clustered surgery procedure types that share comparable characteristics (e.g. expected duration). Scheduling OR blocks leaves many options for operational surgery scheduling and this increases the variation in usage of both the OR and downstream beds. Therefore, we schedule surgery groups to reduce the options for operational scheduling, ultimately bridging the gap between tactical and operational scheduling. We propose a single step mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach that approximates the bed and OR usage and a simulated annealing approach. Both approaches are compared on a real-life data set and results show that the MILP performs best in terms of solution quality and computation time. Furthermore, the results show that our model may improve the OR utilization from 71{\%} to 85{\%} and decrease the bed usage variation from 53 beds to 11 beds compared to historical data. To show the potential and robustness of our model, we discuss several variants of the model requiring minor modifications. The use of surgery groups makes it easier to implementation our model in practice and, for operational planners, it is instantly clear where to schedule different types of surgery.},

	abstract = {This paper, for the first time, studies vehicle routing problems with synchronized visits (VRPS) and stochastic travel and service times. In addition to considering a home healthcare scheduling problem, we introduce an operating room scheduling problem with stochastic durations as a novel application of VRPS. We formulate VRPS with stochastic times as a two-stage stochastic integer programming model that, unlike the deterministic models in the VRPS literature, does not have any big-M constraints. This advantage comes at the cost of a large number of second-stage integer variables. We prove that the integrality constraints on second-stage variables can be relaxed, and therefore, we can apply the L-shaped algorithm and its branch-and-cut implementation to solve the problem. We enhance the model by developing valid inequalities and a lower bounding functional. We analyze the subproblems of the L-shaped algorithm and devise a specialized algorithm for them that is significantly faster than standard linear programming algorithms. Computational results show that the branch-and-cut algorithm optimally solves stochastic home healthcare scheduling instances with 15 patients and 10{\%}?30{\%} of synchronized visits. It also finds solutions with an average optimality gap of 3.57{\%} for instances with 20 patients. Furthermore, the branch-and-cut algorithm optimally solves stochastic operating room scheduling problems with 20 surgeries.},

	n2 = {This paper, for the first time, studies vehicle routing problems with synchronized visits (VRPS) and stochastic travel and service times. In addition to considering a home healthcare scheduling problem, we introduce an operating room scheduling problem with stochastic durations as a novel application of VRPS. We formulate VRPS with stochastic times as a two-stage stochastic integer programming model that, unlike the deterministic models in the VRPS literature, does not have any big-M constraints. This advantage comes at the cost of a large number of second-stage integer variables. We prove that the integrality constraints on second-stage variables can be relaxed, and therefore, we can apply the L-shaped algorithm and its branch-and-cut implementation to solve the problem. We enhance the model by developing valid inequalities and a lower bounding functional. We analyze the subproblems of the L-shaped algorithm and devise a specialized algorithm for them that is significantly faster than standard linear programming algorithms. Computational results show that the branch-and-cut algorithm optimally solves stochastic home healthcare scheduling instances with 15 patients and 10{\%}?30{\%} of synchronized visits. It also finds solutions with an average optimality gap of 3.57{\%} for instances with 20 patients. Furthermore, the branch-and-cut algorithm optimally solves stochastic operating room scheduling problems with 20 surgeries.},

Patients are only scheduled in the operational phase when the actual demand is known. However, the actual patient demand may differ from the expected demand. In this paper, we integrate the surgical case planning and scheduling problem and include the nurse re-rostering decision and nurse assignment to specific patients in order to utilise the operating room department as efficiently as possible and maximise the operating room profit. We propose a two-phase heuristic that uses the LP solution generated via column generation to construct a high-quality feasible solution. Computational experiments have been conducted on a diverse artificial data set generated in a controlled and structured manner and real-life data from the Sina Hospital (Tehran, Iran). We show that the presented approach is able to produce (near-)optimal solutions and benchmark the procedure with other optimisation strategies and solution methodologies.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the operating room planning problem at the tactical and operational decision levels considering upstream and downstream units. For this purpose, a multi-objective mathematical programming model is proposed for the construction of master surgical scheduling and the allocation of elective and emergency surgeries. This model encompasses the profits of all stakeholders in the operating theater. A new policy, named complete opening policy, is introduced for the management of operating rooms that has some particular benefits compared to the conventional policy. Then, a scenario-based robust formulation is proposed to consider the uncertainties of surgery duration, length of stay and emergency demands. Because the simpler variants of this problem are known to be NP-complete, a new two-stage heuristic algorithm is developed for solving its large-scale instances. During the first stage, this algorithm generates an initial solution using a greedy constructive algorithm. To improve the initial solution, the algorithm applies eight actions and searches the neighborhoods. In the second stage, the algorithm evaluates whether or not closing an operating room could improve the incumbent solution. A heuristic algorithm, named partial-mixed integer programming, is also adapted as a benchmark algorithm. This algorithm incorporates the CPLEX solver and a very large-scale neighborhood search. Eventually, a hospital in Iran is introduced and evaluated. The computational results demonstrate that the application of the proposed methodology could potentially decrease the waiting cost, the overtime and idleness of operating rooms, and the total deviation from the average beds used in upstream and downstream. The computational results also show that an increase of two beds in the intensive care unit might potentially reduce the waiting cost by 3.6{\%} and the total average of overtime and idleness of operating rooms each day by 20.3{\%}.},

The state-of-the-art model in the IORPS literature is a hybrid constraint programming (CP) and integer programming (IP) technique that is efficiently solved by a multi-featured Branch-Price-\&Cut (BP\&C) algorithm. We extend the IORPS literature in two ways: (i) we develop new mixed-integer programming (MIP) and CP models that improve the existing CP-IP model and (ii) we develop various combinatorial Benders decomposition algorithms that outperform the existing BP\&C algorithm. Using the same dataset as used for the existing methods, we show that our MIP model achieves an average optimality gap of 3.84{\%}, outperforming the existing CP-IP model that achieves an average optimality gap of 11.84{\%}. Furthermore, our MIP model is 54--92 times faster than the CP-IP model in some of the optimally solved instances of the problem. We demonstrate that our best Benders decomposition approach achieves an average optimality gap of 0.88{\%}, whereas the existing BP\&C algorithm achieves an average optimality gap of 2.81{\%}.},

To lower the total costs of operating rooms from both sides of patients and operating rooms, a mathematical model is proposed with objective of minimizing the patient waiting costs and operating room overtime costs. Some structural properties of the studied problem are proposed, and two heuristic algorithms are presented to solve the patient assignment problem based on these structural properties. The studied operating room scheduling problem is proved to be NP-hard, and a hybrid GWO-VNS algorithm combining Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) with Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS) is developed to obtain a good solution, where the heuristic algorithms are incorporated. Finally, computational experiments are conducted to test the efficiency, stability, and convergence speed of the proposed algorithm and compared with other mainstream algorithms.

Scheduling surgeries including sequencing them, assigning resources to them and determining their start times is a complicated task for hospital managers. Surgery referrals usually include elective surgeries that are admitted before the planning horizon of the schedule and emergency surgeries that arrive during this horizon and require fast services. In this paper, we presented a mathematical model for scheduling electives and emergencies. In our model, we considered surgeries as projects with multi-activities. We implemented the Break-in-Moments (BIMs) technique in this structure, which to our best knowledge has not been implemented in the literature before. We examined this method with real data from a medium-sized Norwegian hospital and observed that this method reduces the waiting time of emergencies to be inserted into the schedule without dedicating any OR merely to emergencies. In such a way, this method counterbalances between efficient OR usage and responsiveness for emergency surgeries.},

By considering the specific distribution function for uncertain variables, deterministic mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is developed such that the proposed problem can be solved by a linear programming solver in small size. Besides an effective heuristic method is proposed for the moderate size problem. To indicate the applicability of the proposed model, it has been applied to a real radiology center.

This research proposes a new approach based on Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) algorithm for tacking the PASP. BBO was inspired from the idea of species migration between different habitats. Due to the complexity of the search space in PASP, the original BBO has been equipped with a guided bed selection (GBS) mechanism in order to improve its results and performance, as well as the operator capabilities of BBO which are modified to improve its diversity. These three variants of BBO are compared with each other using six de facto data sets that are widely used in the literature with varying sizes and complexity. The modified BBO is able to yield better results than the other variants.

We hypothesize that the scheduling office (ORSO) leading the modification scheduling process could increase OR utilization rate. Using retrospective data from a single tertiary hospital in two consecutive calendar years, we compared OR utilization rate, the number of daily cases and cumulative operative time in the pre- and post-implementation of scheduling process alteration. We operated about 100,609 cases in the OR during the study period. Daytime utilization rate increased from 85.6{\%} to 89.4{\%} (P < 0.001); overall OR utilization rate from 115.1{\%} to 117.6{\%} (P = 0.019); daily case numbers from 229.9 $\pm$7.3 to 239.6 $\pm$7.6 (P = 0.0.14); and cumulative operation time of total and daytime cases from 611.7 case-hour/day to 624.5 case-hour/day (P = 0.013) and from 510.8 case-hour/day to 533.8 case-hour/day (P < 0.001), respectively. Evening/night time case-hour significantly decreased from 100.9 case-hour/day to 90.7 case-hour/day (P < 0.001). The optimization of the scheduling process and coordination by the office during regular workhours resulted in enhanced OR efficiency. The OR scheduling office can act as a control tower to make OR management more flexible, which can improve efficiency and carry financial benefits in tertiary hospitals.},

We consider a MSSP where elective and emergency patients can be treated in the same operating rooms. In addition to elective-dedicated operating room slots, flexible operating room slots are introduced to handle the fluctuating demand of emergency patients. To solve the MSSP, we propose a simulation-optimization approach consisting of a two-stage stochastic optimization model and a discrete-event simulation model. For the two-stage stochastic optimization model, uncertain arrivals of emergency patients are represented by discrete scenarios. The discrete-event simulation model is developed to address uncertainty related to the surgery duration and the length of stay at the hospital, and to test the Master Surgery Schedule (MSS) developed by the optimization model in a stochastic operational-level environment. In addition, the simulation model is used to generate scenarios for the optimization model. We present some general advice for surgery scheduling based on testing the optimization model in a numerical study. The simulation-optimization approach is applied to a case study from a hospital department that treats both elective and emergency patients. The optimized MSS outperforms the manually generated MSS, both in terms of emergency waiting time for surgery, and emergency interruptions to the flow of electives.},

	abstract = {The Nurse Rostering Problem (NRP) is a complex scheduling problem in which nurses must be assigned to shifts according to a set of constraints. The NRP is difficult to solve to optimality due to its combinatorial structure. In this paper, we propose a hybrid solution algorithm that combines Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) based heuristics---namely Fix-and-Relax (F\&R) and Fix-and-Optimize (F\&O)---and Simulated Annealing (SA) to solve the NRP. In MIP-based heuristics, a problem is decomposed into a set of smaller problems and each problem is iteratively solved to optimality. In the hybrid approach, high-quality initial solutions are obtained via the F\&R algorithm and fed to the SA part of the algorithm. When solutions can no longer be improved, the F\&O algorithm is inserted into the SA algorithm. This enables the hybrid algorithm to diversify the search space and provide better solutions. To assess the quality and efficiency of the hybrid approach, we use 24 publicly available test instances recently introduced in literature in the field. Computational results show that the hybrid method outperforms other advanced solution techniques in most of the test data and seven new best-known results are reported.},

Nurse rostering problem (NRP) is the research problem in this paper. This study proposes two heuristic algorithms, which are the decision tree method and the greedy search algorithm, to integrate with metaheuristic algorithms in order to generate better initial solutions in less time and to improve solutions'quality. This research examines the algorithms'performance based on two scenarios and two metaheuristic algorithms: bat algorithm (BA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). For the two scenarios, BA (or PSO) with the decision tree method outperforms BA (or PSO) without the decision tree method, and BA (or PSO) with the greedy search algorithm outperforms BA (or PSO) without the greedy search algorithm. Furthermore, the results show that BA (or PSO) with the decision tree method and the greedy search algorithm can generate better initial solutions in less time and improve solutions'quality.},

@article{x289,
	abstract = {Hospitals have encountered challenges in performing efficient scheduling and good resource management to ensure a high quality of healthcare is provided to their patients. Operating room (OR) scheduling is one of the issues that has gained our attention because it is related to workflow efficiency and critical care of hospitals. Automatic scheduling and high predictive accuracy of surgical case duration have a critical role in improving OR utilization. To estimate surgical case duration, most hospitals might rely on historical averages based on a specific surgeon or a specific procedure type obtained from electronic medical record (EMR) scheduling systems. However, the low predictive accuracy with EMR data leads to negative impacts on patients and hospitals, such as rescheduling of surgeries and cancellation. This study aims to improve and interpret the prediction of surgical case duration with machine learning (ML) methodology. A large data set containing 170,748 surgical cases (from Jan 2017 to Dec 2019) was obtained from a hospital, and it covered a broad variety of details on patients, surgeries, specialties and surgical teams. In addition, a more recent data set with 8,672 cases (from Mar to Apr 2020) was available to be used for time-wise evaluation. Historical averages were computed from the EMR data for surgeon- or procedure-specific cases, and served as baseline models for comparison. Subsequently, models were built with linear regression, random forest and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) algorithms, and were evaluated with R-square (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), percentage overage (actual duration longer than prediction), underage (shorter than prediction) and within (absolute duration differences falling within minimum(maximum(15 \%,15 min), 60 min) of prediction). The XGB model was superior to the other models, achieving a higher R2 (84 \%) as well as a lower MAE (31.1 min) and inaccurate percentage (24.4 \%). In addition, XGB predictions were analyzed with Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). SHAP interpretation on complex cases (e.g. containing more than 2 procedures) unraveled that older primary surgeons took shorter time to complete the surgery and primary surgeons with longer previous surgical time within a week took more time to complete the surgery. Longer durations were utilized when patient{\textquoteright}s hypertension status was unknown. Meanwhile, SHAP interpretation on model loss showed that the loss values of elder primary surgeons increased for cases with larger deviations in prediction suggesting additional information related to surgeon is required for model improvement. Overall, this study applied ML techniques in the field of OR scheduling to reduce the medical and financial burden for healthcare management. The results revealed the impact of main factors (e.g. anesthesia, procedure types, no. of procedure) and interaction effects (e.g. no. of procedure x primary surgeon{\textquoteright}s age) in surgical case duration prediction as well as identified the feature that contributes to errors in prediction.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo external funding received.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:We have obtained an institutional review board approval (CMUH109-REC1-091) from China Medical University Hospital.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = {A heuristic method based on column generation is presented for the nurse rostering problem. The method differs significantly from an exact column generation approach or a branch and price algorithm because it performs an incomplete search which quickly produces good solutions but does not provide valid lower bounds. It is effective on large instances for which it has produced best known solutions on benchmark data instances. Several innovations were required to produce solutions for the largest instances within acceptable computation times. These include using a fast first-order linear programming solver based on the work of Chambolle and Pock to approximately solve the restricted master problem. A low-accuracy but fast, first-order linear programming method is shown to be an effective option for this master problem. The pricing problem is modelled as a resource constrained shortest path problem with a two-phase dynamic programming method. The model requires only two resources. This enables it to be solved efficiently. A commercial integer programming solver is also tested on the instances. The commercial solver was unable to produce solutions on the largest instances whereas the heuristic method was able to. It is also compared against the state-of-the-art, previously published methods on these instances. Analysis of the branching strategy developed is presented to provide further insights. All the source code for the algorithms presented has been made available on-line for reproducibility of results and to assist other researchers.},

Managing operating rooms is challenging due to conflicting priorities and preferences of various stakeholders and the inherent uncertainty of surgery durations. In this study, we consider the next-day scheduling problem of a hospital operating room. Given the list and the sequence of non-identical surgeries to be performed in the next day, one needs to determine the scheduled durations of surgeries where the actual duration of each surgery is uncertain. Our objective is to minimize the weighted sum of expected patient waiting times, room idle time and overtime. First, we provide a reformulation of the objective function in terms of auxiliary functions with a recursive pattern that enables exact analysis of the optimal surgery durations at the expense of high CPU time. Next, we develop and analyze simple-to-use and close-to-optimal scheduling heuristics motivated by practice, for the OR managers to deploy in the field. Our proposed hybrid heuristic attains 1.22{\%} average performance gap and worst average optimality gap of 2.77{\%}. Our solution is easy to implement as it does not require any advanced optimization tool, which is the reality of many operating room environments.},

	abstract = {Patient unpunctuality significantly disrupts the operations of healthcare facilities, reduces provider productivity, and increases healthcare costs. To alleviate the negative impact of unpunctual patients, this study addresses the appointment scheduling (AS) in the simultaneous presence of unpunctual patients, multiple servers, and no-shows. To determine the appointment schedule, we propose a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model to minimise the total cost incurred by patient waiting and clinic overtime. It becomes challenging for a standard solver to solve this model due to the dynamic patient-to-server assignment decisions that are proactively anticipated in the determination of appointment times. To deal with this problem, a stochastic approximation algorithm is proposed under unbiased gradient estimators. The effectiveness and efficiency of this algorithm are validated in extensive numerical experiments that compare it with Benders decomposition and a heuristic algorithm. Further, the features of the optimal appointment schedule are analysed: (i) the shape of the appointment intervals relies on the number of servers; (ii) the length of intervals is sensitive to no-shows; (iii) the initial block size is greatly affected by patient unpunctuality. Managerial insights are also provided for hospital managers to schedule unpunctual patients in practice.},

To overcome the long running time of Benders decomposition, we simplify the master problem in the algorithm and propose a Benders decomposition-based algorithm to find a near-optimal solution. Finally, we conduct a series of numerical experiments to illustrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithm, examine the impact of the number of stages, stochastic service times and no-shows on the optimal job allowances and performance indicators (i.e. waiting times and idle times) and investigate two easy-to-implement sequence rules. The computational results show that both our proposed Benders decomposition-based algorithm and easy-to-implement sequence rules perform well.},

@article{x298,
	abstract = {Background and Objective Operating Rooms (ORs) are among the most expensive services in hospitals. A challenge to optimize the OR efficiency is to improve the surgery scheduling task, which requires the estimation of surgical time duration. Surgeons or programming units (based on people's experience) typically do the duration estimation using an experience-based strategy, which may include some bias, such as overestimating the surgery time, increasing ORs' operational cost. Methods This paper analyzes a machine learning-based solution for surgical time predictions. We apply and compare four machine-learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, Regression Trees, and Bagged Trees) to predict the surgical time duration at a tertiary referral university hospital in Bogot{\'a}, Colombia. Historical data from 2004 until 2019 was used to train the algorithms. Comparison among algorithms was given in terms of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the predicted surgery duration and the algorithms' computing time. The algorithm with the best performance was compared to the currently used experience-based method. Results All the ML algorithms predict the surgery duration with an error between 26 and 37 min. The best overall performance was obtained using Bagged Trees (26 min RMSE, 3.16 min training time, 0.49 min testing time) when using a subset of the DB with the nine specialties containing 80% of the surgeries. Bagged Trees also outperformed the experience-based method with a lower RMSE; however, it also shifted from a predominant overestimation to underestimating surgeries' duration. Conclusions Different ML algorithms for predicting the surgical time duration, showing and comparing their performance. Bagged Trees showed the best performance in terms of RMSE and computing time. Depending on the initial data, Bagged Trees outperformed the experience-based method, but future work is necessary to suit it, like any other ML algorithm, to the hospitals' needs.},

	abstract = {Decisions on the number of surgeries to perform during a typical week in an operating room (OR) generally affect downstream resources such as intensive care units (ICU), recovery rooms, or regular inpatient wards. Since capacity of e.g. ICUs is highly restricted, this bottleneck plays an important role in the management of an efficient flow of surgical patients through the system. This paper aims to provide hospital decision makers with easy-to-follow guidelines for the daily patient scheduling decisions and presents a novel chance-constraint optimisation model to develop efficient admission templates for elective surgeries on a tactical level. With a given patient mix, we decide on the number of surgeries that can realistically be treated during a typical week, with respect to limited resources of OR and ICU and considering stochastic demand. The benefit of such templates is exemplified using a dedicated simulation model in a realistic case study. The simulation model rebuilds daily operations in OR and ICU and allows to mimic typical decision making in OR and ICU. Computational studies show that continually applying such templates as admission guidelines leads to a well-utilised OR and efficiently used ICUs. The extensive simulation studies confirm that the template plans obtained from the chance-constraint optimisation model can provide guidance for an operating room planner.},

	abstract = {The Operating Room Scheduling (ORS) problem is the task of assigning patients to operating rooms (ORs), taking into account different specialties, lengths, and priority scores of each planned surgery, OR session durations, and the availability of beds for the entire length of stay (LOS) both in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and in the wards. A proper solution to the ORS problem is of primary importance for the healthcare service quality and the satisfaction of patients in hospital environments. In this paper we first present a solution to the problem based on Answer Set Programming (ASP). The solution is tested on benchmarks with realistic sizes and parameters, on three scenarios for the target length on 5-day scheduling, common in small--medium-sized hospitals, and results show that ASP is a suitable solving methodology for the ORS problem in such setting. Then, we also performed a scalability analysis on the schedule length up to 15 days, which still shows the suitability of our solution also on longer plan horizons. Moreover, we also present an ASP solution for the rescheduling problem, that is, when the offline schedule cannot be completed for some reason. Finally, we introduce a web framework for managing ORS problems via ASP that allows a user to insert the main parameters of the problem, solve a specific instance, and show results graphically in real time.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses a planning decision for operating rooms (ORs) that aim at supporting hospital management. Focusing on elective patients, we determined the master surgical schedule (MSS) on a one-week time horizon. We assigned the specialties to available sessions and allocated surgeries to them while taking into consideration the priorities of the outpatients in the ambulatory surgical discipline. Surgeries were selected from the waiting lists according to their priorities. The proposed approach considered operating theater (OT) restrictions, patients'priorities and accounted for the availability of both intensive care unit (ICU) beds and post-surgery beds. Since the management decisions of hospitals are usually made in an uncertain environment, our approach considered the uncertainty of surgery duration and availability of ICU bed. Two robust optimization approaches that kept the model computationally tractable are described and applied to deal with uncertainty. Computational results based on a medium-sized French hospital archives have been presented to compare the robust models to the deterministic counterpart and to demonstrate the price of robustness.},

This article finds the optimal schedule of surgeries by minimizing operating rooms? idle times while maximizing the number of scheduled surgeries during the most effective and desirable time windows. Surgeries during ideal time windows are encouraged by assigning bonus weights in the objective function. Stated and implied benefits of this strategy include mitigating financial loss, complications, and death rate due to a reduction in surgery delays. We introduce a binary programming model for scheduling operating rooms and a mixed integer binary program for planning and scheduling both operating and recovery rooms for elected patients under deterministic conditions. We apply an open scheduling strategy for assigning operating rooms to surgeons and a Lagrangian relaxation method for finding promising solutions. We move hard constraints to the objective to reduce the complexity of the proposed NP-hard model. We incorporate a sub-gradient method that selects the best penalty vector. Finally, we benchmark the results to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed solutions.},

@article{x380,
	abstract = {This paper proposes an operating room (OR) scheduling model to assign a group of next-day patients to ORs while adhering to OR availability, priorities, and OR overtime constraints. Existing studies usually consider OR scheduling problems by ignoring the influence of uncertainties in surgery durations on the OR assignment. In this paper, we address this issue by formulating accurate patient waiting times as the cumulative sum of uncertain surgery durations from the robust discrete approach point of view. Specifically, by considering the patients\&rsquo; uncertain surgery duration, we formulate the robust OR scheduling model to minimize the sum of the fixed OR opening cost, the patient waiting penalty cost, and the OR overtime cost. Then, we adopt the box uncertainty set to specify the uncertain surgery duration, and a robustness coefficient is introduced to control the robustness of the model. This resulting robust model is essentially intractable in its original form because there are uncertain variables in both the objective function and constraint. To make this model solvable, we then transform it into a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model by employing the robust discrete optimization theory and the strong dual theory. Moreover, to evaluate the reliability of the robust OR scheduling model under different robustness coefficients, we theoretically analyze the constraint violation probability associated with overtime constraints. Finally, an in-depth numerical analysis is conducted to verify the proposed model\&rsquo;s effectiveness and to evaluate the robustness coefficient\&rsquo;s impact on the model performance. Our analytical results indicate the following: (1) With the robustness coefficient, we obtain the tradeoff relationship between the total management cost and the constraint violation probability, i.e., a smaller robustness coefficient yields remarkably lower total management cost at the expense of a noticeably higher constraint violation probability and vice versa. (2) The obtained total management cost is sensitive to small robustness coefficient values, but it hardly changes as the robustness coefficient increases to a specific value. (3) The obtained total management cost becomes increasingly sensitive to the perturbation factor with the decrease in constraint violation probability.},

A decision to use an evolutionary algorithm implies that the user adopts the main design decisions behind this framework. Thus, the main algorithm setup follows automatically: the algorithm is based on a population of candidate solutions that is manipulated by selection, recombination, and mutation operators. To obtain a concrete, executable EA, the user only needs to specify a few details. In this chapter we have a closer look at these details, named parameters. We discuss the notion of EA parameters and explain why the task of designing an evolutionary algorithm can be seen as the problem of finding appropriate parameter values.

	abstract = {In the preceding chapters we described the main varieties of evolutionary algorithms and described various examples of how they might be suitably implemented for different applications. In this chapter we turn our attention to systems in which, rather than existing as stand-alone algorithms, EA-based approaches are either incorporated within larger systems, or alternatively have other methods or data structures incorporated within them. This category of algorithms is very successful in practice and forms a rapidly growing research area with great potential. This area and the algorithms that form its subject of study are named memetic algorithms (MA). In this chapter we explain the rationale behind MAs, outline a number of possibilities for combining EAs with other techniques, and give some guidelines for designing successful hybrid algorithms.},

	abstract = {Unlike most of the examples we have used so far, real-world environments typically contain sources of uncertainty. This means that if we measure the fitness of a solution more than once, we will not always get the same result. Of course, biological evolution happens in just such a dynamic environment, but there are also many EA applications in environments featuring change or noise when solutions are evaluated. In these nonstationary situations the search algorithm has to be designed so that it can compensate for the unpredictable environment by monitoring its performance and altering some aspects of its behaviour. An objective of the resulting adaptation is not to find a single optimum, but rather to select a sequence of values over time that maximise or minimise some measure of the evaluations, such as the average or worst. This chapter discusses the various sources of unpredictability, and describes the principal adaptations to the basic EA in response to them.},

This means that not all possible combinations of variable values represent valid solutions to the problem at hand, and we examine how this impacts on the design of an evolutionary algorithm. This issue has great practical relevance because many real-world problems are constrained. It is also theoretically challenging, since many intractable problems (NP-hard, NP-complete, etc.) are constrained. Unfortunately, constraint handling is not straightforward in an EA, because the variation operators (mutation and recombination) are typically `blind'to constraints. This means that even if the parents satisfy some constraints, there is no guarantee their offspring will. This chapter reviews the most commonly used techniques for constraint handling, identifies a number of common features, and provides some guidance for the algorithm designer.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses the topic of interactive evolution, where the measure of a solution's fitness is provided by a human's subjective judgement, rather than by some predefined model of a problem. Of course, the world around us is full of examples of human intervention in biological evolution, in the form of pets, garden flowers, food crops and farm animals. Applications of Interactive Evolutionary Algorithms (IEAs) range from capturing aesthetics in art and design, to the personalisation of artefacts such as medical devices. When including humans `in the loop'we must consider their peculiar characteristics. On one hand, they can provide insight and guidance beyond simply selecting parents for breeding. On the other, they can be inconsistent, and are prone to fatigue and loss of attention. These factors make it inappropriate to use the `traditional'model of an EA generating possibly thousands of candidate solutions. This chapter describes and explains some of the major algorithmic changes that have been proposed to cope with these issues.},

	abstract = {In most of this book we have been concerned with problems where the quality of a proposed solution can be relatively easily measured in isolation by some externally provided fitness function. Evaluating a solution may involve an element of random noise, but does not particularly depend on the context in which it is done. However, there are two obvious scenarios in which this set-up does not really hold. The first occurs when a solution represents some strategy or design that works in opposition to some competitor that is itself adapting. The most obvious example here would be adversarial game-playing such as chess. The second comes about when a solution being evolved does not represent a complete solution to a problem, but instead can only be evaluated as part of a greater whole, that together accomplishes some task. An example might be the evolution of a set of traffic-light controllers, each to be sited on a different junction, with fitness reflecting their joint performance in reducing congestion over a day's simulated traffic. Both of these are examples of coevolution. This chapter gives an overview of the types of scenarios where coevolution might be usefully applied, and of some of the issues involved in designing a successful application.},

The Holy Grail of these efforts is the formulation of predictive models describing the behaviour of an EA on arbitrary problems, and permitting the specification of the most efficient form of optimiser for any given problem. However, (at least in the authors'opinions) this is unlikely ever to be realised, and most researchers will currently happily settle for techniques that provide any verifiable insights into EA behaviour, even on simple test problems. The reason for what might seem like limited ambition lies in one simple fact: evolutionary algorithms are hugely complex systems, involving many random factors. Moreover, while the field of EAs is fairly young, it is worth noting that the field of population genetics and evolutionary theory has a head start of more than a hundred years, and is still battling against the barrier of complexity.},

Minimizing the makespan of each job using a few resource is a challenging problem. In this study, it is aimed to 1) automatically determine the priority of jobs to reduce the waiting time in the line, 2) automatically allocate the machine resource to each job. In this work, the problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. We use GA algorithm to automatically determine job priorities and resource demand for minimizing individual makespan and resource usage. Finally, the experimental results show that our proposed priority list generation algorithm is more effective than current priority list producing method in the aspects of makespan and allocated machine count.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we develop a stochastic optimization model for a surgical scheduling problem considering a single operating room. We arrange a set of elective surgeries into appropriate time blocks, and determine their planned start time and specific sequence. Due to the complexity of the original formulation, we reformulate our model as a two-stage mixed-integer problem. We consider the planning decision in the first stage and the sequencing decision in the second stage (based on the first one). The goal of this paper is to obtain a nearly optimal schedule in reasonable computational time. The term ``optimal''is defined as the lowest surgically related cost while achieving the given threshold with respect to some specific deterministic or stochastic performance measures. The optimization model involves expected and probabilistic formulations that are analytically intractable. This implies that traditional mathematical programming techniques cannot be used directly. Therefore, we propose adapted rapid-screening and stochastic-approximation algorithms to deal with the first-stage and the second-stage problems, respectively. In both algorithms, we can apply either the Laplace transform or simulation methods to either evaluate or estimate the desired performance measures. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are more favorable compared to existing approaches.},

	abstract = {This study is concerned with the determination of an optimal appointment schedule in an outpatient-inpatient hospital system where the inpatient exams can be cancelled based on certain rules while the outpatient exams cannot be cancelled. Stochastic programming models were formulated and solved to tackle the stochasticity in the procedure durations and patient arrival patterns. The first model, a two-stage stochastic programming model, is formulated to optimize the slot size. The second model further optimizes the inpatient block (IPB) placement and slot size simultaneously. A computational method is developed to solve the second optimization problem. A case study is conducted using the data from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) centers of Lahey Hospital and Medical Center (LHMC). The current schedule and the schedules obtained from the optimization models are evaluated and compared using simulation based on FlexSim Healthcare. Results indicate that the overall weighted cost can be reduced by 11.6{\%} by optimizing the slot size and can be further reduced by an additional 12.6{\%} by optimizing slot size and IPB placement simultaneously. Three commonly used sequencing rules (IPBEG, OPBEG, and a variant of ALTER rule) were also evaluated. The results showed that when optimization tools are not available, ALTER variant which evenly distributes the IPBs across the day has the best performance. Sensitivity analysis of weights for patient waiting time, machine idle time and exam cancellations further supports the superiority of ALTER variant sequencing rules compared to the other sequencing methods. A Pareto frontier was also developed and presented between patient waiting time and machine idle time to enable medical centers with different priorities to obtain solutions that accurately reflect their respective optimal tradeoffs. An extended optimization model was also developed to incorporate the emergency patient arrivals. The optimal schedules from the extended model show only minor differences compared to those from the original model, thus proving the robustness of the scheduling solutions obtained from our optimal models against the impacts of emergency patient arrivals.},

Due to the perishable characteristics of this product, saving a large number of blood units on inventory causes the spoil of these limited and infrequent resources.

In this paper, an integer programming model was proposed to minimize the total cost, shortage, and wastage of blood products in Namazi hospital by considering the different types of blood groups. The parameters in the real-world are uncertain, and this problem will be examined in the paper. The robust fuzzy possibilistic programming approach is presented, and a numerical illustration of the Namazi hospital is used to show the application of the proposed optimization model. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to validate the model for problems such as certainty level, coefficient weight, and penalty value of the objective function in the robust fuzzy possibilistic programming. The numerical results imply the model is able to control uncertainty and the robustness price is imposed on the system; therefore, the value of the objective function in the robust fuzzy possibilistic is 80{\%} lower than probabilistic.},

	abstract = {Many healthcare institutions are interested in reducing costs and in maintaining a good quality of care. The operating room department is typically one of the most costly units in a hospital. Hospital managers are always interested in finding effective ways of using operating rooms to minimize operating costs. In this research, we study the operating room scheduling problem. We consider the use of a weekly surgery schedule with an open scheduling strategy that takes into account the availabilities of surgeons and operating rooms. The objective is to minimize the total operating cost while maximizing the utilization of the operating rooms but also minimizing overtime use. A revised mathematical model is proposed that can provide optimal solutions for a surgery size up to 110 surgical cases. Next, two modified heuristics, based on the earliest due date (EDD) and longest processing time (LPT) rules, are proposed to quickly find feasible solutions to the studied problem. Finally, an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm that incorporates the initial solutions, a recovery scheme, local search schemes, and an elitism strategy is proposed. The computational results show that, for a surgery size between 40 and 100 surgical cases, the ABC algorithm found optimal solutions to all of the tested problems. For surgery sizes larger than 110 surgical cases, the ABC algorithm performed significantly better than the two proposed heuristics. The computational results indicate that the proposed ABC is promising and capable of solving large problems.},

	abstract = {Day surgery scheduling allocates hospital resources to day surgical cases and decides on the time to perform the surgeries in the day surgery center (DSC). Based on the day surgery service process of large public hospitals in China, we found that the service efficiency of the process depends on the utilization of hospital resources efficiently and could be optimized through day surgery scheduling. We described it as a flexible flow shop owing to the three-station nature of surgery. Allocating all types of hospital resources to the three stations and determining the length of time for each stage during surgery are crucial to improving the efficiency of DSC. This paper integrates a three-station job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) into the day surgery scheduling and optimization problem. The JSSP was formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model, and the elicitation of the model for scheduling surgeries with different priorities in the DSC is discussed. The model illustrated a case study of the DSC within West China Hospital (WCH). Numerical experiments based on the genetic algorithm design were conducted. Compared to the other optimization strategies, we proposed that the three-station job shop scheduling strategy (TSJS) could not only improve the efficiency and reduce the waiting time of the patients of the DSC in large public hospitals in China but also allow for timely scheduling adjustments during the advent of emergency surgeries.},

@article{x326,
	abstract = {Operating Room (OR) management has been among the mainstream of hospital management research, as ORs are commonly considered as one of the most critical and expensive resources. The complicated connection and interplay between ORs and their upstream and downstream units has recently attracted research attention to focus more on allocating medical resources efficiently for the sake of a balanced coordination. As a critical step, surgical scheduling in the presence of uncertain surgery durations is pivotal but rather challenging since a patient cannot be hospitalized if a recovery bed will not be available to accommodate the admission. To tackle the challenge, we propose an overflow strategy that allows patients to be assigned to an undesignated department if the designated one is full. It has been proved that overflow strategy can successfully alleviate the imbalance of capacity utilization. However, some studies indicate that implementation of the overflow strategy exacerbates the readmission rate as well as the length of stay (LOS). To rigorously examine the overflow strategy and explore its optimal solution, we propose a Fuzzy model for surgical scheduling by explicitly considering downstream shortage, as well as the uncertainty of surgery duration and patient LOS. To solve the Fuzzy model, a hybrid algorithm (so-called GA-P) is developed, stemming from Genetic Algorithm (GA). Extensive numerical results demonstrate the plausible efficiency of the GA-P algorithm, especially for large-scale scheduling problems (e.g., comprehensive hospitals). Additionally, it is shown that the overflow cost plays a critical role in determining the efficiency of the overflow strategy; viz., benefits from the overflow strategy can be reduced as the overflow cost increases, and eventually almost vanishes when the cost becomes sufficiently large. Finally, the Fuzzy model is tested to be effective in terms of simplicity and reliability, yet without cannibalizing the patient admission rate.},

	abstract = {The health care system is characterized by limited resources, including the physical facilities as well as skilled human resources. Due to the extensive fixed cost of medical facilities and the high specialization required by the medical staff, the problem of resource scarcity in a health care supply chain is much more acute than in other industries. In the pandemic of the Coronavirus, where medical services are the most important services in communities, and protective and preventive guidelines impose new restrictions on the system, the issue of resource allocation will be more complicated and significantly affect the efficiency of health care systems. In this paper, the problem of activating the operating rooms in hospitals, assigning active operating rooms to the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, assigning specialty teams to the operating rooms and assigning the elective and emergency patients to the specialty teams, and scheduling their operations is studied by considering the new constraints of protective and preventive guidelines of the Coronavirus. To address these issues, a mixed-integer mathematical programming model is proposed. Moreover, to consider the uncertainty in the surgery duration of elective and emergency patients, the stochastic robust optimization approach is utilized. The proposed model is applied for the planning of operating rooms in the cardiovascular department of a hospital in Iran, and the results highlight the role of proper management in supplying sufficient medical resources effectively to respond to patients and scheduled surgical team to overcome the pressure on hospital resources and medical staff results from pandemic conditions.},

	abstract = {Operating rooms have become the most important areas in hospitals because of the scarcity and cost of resources. The present study investigates operating room scheduling and rescheduling considering the priority of surgical patients in a specialized hospital. The ultimate purpose of scheduling is to minimize patient waiting time, surgeon idle time between surgeries, and penalties for deviations from operating room preferences. A mathematical programming model is presented to solve the problem. Because the problem is strongly NP-hard, two heuristic algorithms are presented. A heuristic algorithm based on a mathematical programming model with local search obtains near-optimal solutions for all the samples. The average relative deviation of this algorithm is 0.02%. In continuous, heuristic algorithms performance have been investigated by increasing the number of patients and reduce the number of recovery beds. Next, a rescheduling heuristic algorithm is presented to deal with real-time situations. This algorithm presents fewer changes resulting from rescheduling in comparison with the scheduling problem. },

We assess whether there is any theoretical basis to expect increased productivity in terms of number of operations completed. A review of observational studies found that while there is a perception of increased surgical output for one surgeon, there is no evidence of increased productivity compared with two surgeons working in parallel. There is potential for overlapping surgery to have some positive impact in situations where turnover times between cases are long, operations are short (<2?h) and where ?critical portions? of surgery constitute about half of the total operation time. However, any advantages must be balanced against safety, ethical and training concerns.},

	abstract = {The operating room (OR) is considered a major cost center and revenue generator for hospitals. Multiple factors contribute to OR delays and impact patient safety, patient satisfaction scores, and hospital financial performance. Reducing OR delays allows better utilization of OR resources and staffing and improves patient satisfaction while decreasing operating costs. Accurate scheduling can be the basis to achieve these goals. The objective of this initial study was to identify factors not normally documented in the electronic health record (EHR) that may contribute to or be indicators of OR delays. <i>Materials and Methods</i>. A retrospective data analysis was performed analyzing 67,812 OR cases from 12 surgical specialties at a small university medical center from 2010 through the first quarter of 2017. Data from the hospital\&{\#}x2019;s EHR were exported and subjected to statistical analysis using Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). <i>Results</i>. Statistical analysis of the extracted EHR data revealed factors that were associated with OR delays including, surgical specialty, preoperative assessment testing, patient body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification, daily procedure count, and calendar year. <i>Conclusions</i>. Delays hurt OR efficiency on many levels. Identifying those factors may reduce delays and better accommodate the needs of surgeons, staff, and patients thereby leading to improved patient\&{\#}x2019;s outcomes and patient satisfaction. Reducing delays can decrease operating costs and improve the financial position of the operating theater as well as that of the hospital. Anesthesiology teams can play a key role in identifying factors that cause delays and implementing mitigating efficiencies.},

	abstract = {Elective surgery patients have surgery in the operating room (OR), and then recover in one or more downstream recovery units for several consecutive hours or days after surgery. Upstream scheduling that focuses on OR alone or a resource-constrained scheduling approach that fails to account for the inherent uncertainty in surgery durations and postoperative downstream recovery times yield sub-optimal or infeasible schedules and, consequently, higher cost and reduced quality of care. However, modeling such uncertainties at multiple levels is challenging, especially with limited reliable data on the random parameters in the models. Moreover, sequencing of surgical and recovery activities, and the multiple conflicting objectives of all parties involved (including management, clinicians, patients), lead to a class of complex combinatorial and multi-criteria stochastic optimization problems. In this review, we focus on stochastic optimization (SO) approaches for elective surgery scheduling and downstream capacity planning. We describe the art of formulating and solving such a class of stochastic resource-constrained scheduling problems, provide an analysis of existing SO approaches and their challenges, and highlight areas of opportunity for developing tractable, implementable, and data-driven approaches that might be applicable within and outside healthcare operations, particularly where multiple entities/jobs share the same downstream limited resources.},

Time constraints in healthcare systems and medical equipment limited capacity are the most significant considered limitation in the present study. In this regard, since the duration of patient preparation and implementation of treatment processes occur in three states of optimistic, pessimistic, and normal, the introduced parameters are examined relying on a fuzzy uncertainty analysis of the problem. Hence, the model is measured in a real numerical solution sample in a medical center to evaluate and confirm the proposed mathematical model. Then, two meta-heuristic algorithms (NRGA and NSGAII) are implemented on the mathematical model to analyze the proposed model.

This stochastic scheduling problem has been studied in diverse forms. One of the most common approaches used is the sample average approximation (SAA). Our contribution is to study the use of SAA to solve this problem under few historical data using families of log t distributions with varying degrees of freedom. We analyze the results of the SAA method in terms of optimality convergence, the effect of the number of scenarios, and average computational time. Given the case sequence, computational results demonstrate that SAA with an adequate number of scenarios performs close to the exact method. For example, we find that the optimality gap, in units of proportional weighted time, is relatively small when 500 scenarios are used: 99{\%} of the instances have an optimality gap of less than 2.6 7{\%} (1.74{\%}, 1.23{\%}) when there are 3 (9, many) historical samples. Increasing the number of SAA scenarios improves performance, but is not critical when the case sequence is given. However, choosing the number of SAA scenarios becomes critical when the same method is used to choose among sequencing heuristics when there are few historical data. For example, when there are only three (nine, many) historical samples, 99{\%} of the instances have less than 25.38{\%} (13.15{\%}, 6.87{\%}) penalty in using SAA with 500 scenarios to choose the best sequencing heuristic.},

While efficient planning of single resources such as operating rooms, beds, or specific types of staff can already lead to enormous efficiency gains, integrated planning of several resources has been shown to hold even greater potential, and a large number of integrated planning approaches have been presented in the literature over the past decades. This paper provides the first literature review that focuses specifically on the Operations Research and Management Science literature related to integrated planning of different resources in hospitals. We collect the relevant literature and analyze it regarding different aspects such as uncertainty modeling and the use of real-life data. Several cross comparisons reveal interesting insights concerning, e.g., relations between the modeling and solution methods used and the practical implementation of the approaches developed. Moreover, we provide a high-level taxonomy for classifying different resource-focused integration approaches and point out gaps in the literature as well as promising directions for future research.},

	abstract = {Following the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic in early 2020, municipalities, regional governments and policymakers worldwide had to plan their Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) amidst a scenario of great uncertainty. At this early stage of an epidemic, where no vaccine or medical treatment is in sight, algorithmic prediction can become a powerful tool to inform local policymaking. However, when we replicated one prominent epidemiological model to inform health authorities in a region in the south of Brazil, we found that this model relied too heavily on manually predetermined covariates and was too reactive to changes in data trends. Our four proposed models access data of both daily reported deaths and infections as well as take into account missing data (e.g., the under-reporting of cases) more explicitly, with two of the proposed versions also attempting to model the delay in test reporting. We simulated weekly forecasting of deaths from the period from 31/05/2020 until 31/01/2021, with first week data being used as a cold-start to the algorithm, after which we use a lighter variant of the model for faster forecasting. Because our models are significantly more proactive in identifying trend changes, this has improved forecasting, especially in long-range predictions and after the peak of an infection wave, as they were quicker to adapt to scenarios after these peaks in reported deaths. Assuming reported cases were under-reported greatly benefited the model in its stability, and modelling retroactively-added data (due to the ``hot''nature of the data used) had a negligible impact on performance.},

	abstract = {Despite the benefits of studying multiple patient outcomes together, research on between-hospital variation has often focused on single outcomes or disease-specific study populations. In this study we examined nationwide temporal trends and between-hospital variation in in-hospital mortality, 30-day readmissions and length-of-stay above the All-Patient-Refined Diagnoses-Related-Group (APR-DRG)-specific 90th percentile (pLOS). We modelled 13,660,187 admissions derived from an administrative database occurring between 2008 and 2018 in 90 (89{\%}) Belgian acute-care hospitals. We applied an APR-DRG-specific logistic regression to study temporal trends in outcomes, hospital-level associations between outcomes, associations of outcomes with hospitals characteristics, and to evaluate how many and which APR-DRGs explained between-hospital variation. Our proposed analytical model managed to achieve novel insights into healthcare quality of care, illustrating the high potential administrative databases can provide. It was revealed that between-hospital variation in outcomes is likely due to systemic hospital factors. This is illustrated by the fact that baseline bottom-performing hospitals remained underperforming throughout the study period and vice versa. APR-DRG-specific between-hospital variation assessments further confirmed this. When hospitals have overall outcome ratios that significantly deviate from the benchmark, this seems to be driven by a considerable number of APR-DRGs, comprising a diverse set of pathologies. This urges a healthcare policy reform wherein longitudinal follow-up and benchmarking of patient outcomes should become the starting point towards targeted quality improvement interventions.},

	abstract = {Reviewing patients who return to the emergency department (ED) within 72 h (i.e., bounce-back) is a standard quality assurance procedure used to identify correctable system- and clinician-level causes for earlier-than-expected return to the ED and ultimately ensure patients'safety. This study proposes a deep learning (DL) framework to automatically extract features from structured and unstructured Electronic Health Records (EHR) data of ED visits and predict patients who are likely to bounce-back. Data from 120,000+ visits to the ED of four major hospitals in New York city over 4+ years are used to validate the proposed framework. The DL model was able to predict 74.8{\%} of the bounce-backs (AUROC= 0.766). Notably, our results show that leveraging state-of-the-art DL techniques to extract features from unstructured ED physician narrative notes and incorporating them (along with structured vitals and demographics data) in the prediction task can remarkably improve the outcome. In addition, a sensitivity analysis performed on the structured features of the model revealed that factors such as patients'age, type of medical insurance, chronic conditions (especially renal, heart, and respiratory), heart failure, and head or neck trauma are among the top factors increasing the chances of patients'unplanned return to the ED. The proposed framework may be used as a decision support tool to assist emergency care clinicians in the early identification of the high-risk patients who are likely to bounce-back and provide them with timely, appropriate care.},

	abstract = {This paper quantifies the benefits of flattening the curve (with a constant total patient load over the study period) on the risk of a hospital bed shortage in a pandemic. Using discrete-event simulation of patient care paths in hospitals, synthetic data that eliminates issues of confounding affects from the simultaneous occurrence of regional response actions and/or changes in resources, treatments or other situational circumstances, is produced for estimating hospital capacity for pandemic response. Results from systematically designed numerical experiments produced several findings. These include that the higher the acceleration in pandemic patient demand growth, the greater the impact of the intervention. Cutting this acceleration by 75{\%} from the greatest studied rate created over four additional weeks to prepare for an 80{\%} risk of running out of intensive care beds. Additionally, the greater the acceleration in growth, the fewer the days with a high risk of running out of beds, but the greater the total number of critical patients that could not be served with existing resources. Finally, the lower this acceleration, the fewer resources or modifications needed to cope with the surge, but the longer they are needed. The findings further show how hospitals can benefit from analytical tools that exploit digital health information to predict and plan for need levels and time to onset of these levels. These tools can be embedded within a real-time framework in which automated and early warnings can inform the selection of strategies for managing or coping with expected increases in demand for emergency hospital services.},

To develop and compete, hospitals need a performance evaluation system to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of their programs, processes, and workforce. However, hospital data are often uncertain, imprecise, or unknown. In this paper, a fuzzy stochastic data envelopment analysis (DEA) method based on the slacks-based measure of efficiency (SBM) is presented and employed to evaluate the performance of 11 hospitals in an urban setting. Due to the multiplicity of the initially identified criteria, an integrated algorithm based on Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Analytic Network Process (ANP) is used to determine the main and effective criteria. The result of the algorithm shows that the criterion ``total inpatient visits''is the most important criterion in this evaluation. Finally, the proposed model is implemented based on different levels of significance, and the performance of each unit is determined in uncertain conditions.},

	abstract = {Despite extensive research and efforts to optimize Emergency Medical Service (EMS) during the last four decades, there are still critical and fundamental challenges to study. Operational problems experienced during implementation of the proposed models result in the emergence of new concerns and the development of other models. This research examines the optimal location of emergency medical centers in order to offer faster and more efficient care. The purpose of this study is to offer a mathematical model for locating emergency medical centers with the goal of increasing both the quantity and quality of demand coverage. Then, by defining numerical examples, the behavior of the model is analyzed. The model is first solved in small dimensions using GAMS, and due to the np-hard nature of the model, it is then studied in large dimensions using a meta-heuristic algorithm, which uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) in this paper. Finally, the graphs'results are compared to each other. Our findings indicate that as the dimensions of the problem increase, GAMS loses its ability to solve the problem and the solution time by GA decreases compared to GAMS. Ultimately, in a numerical example, we used contour lines to analyze the data. EMS potential points follow these lines and serve as demand points. Given the model's accuracy has been proven with various parameters, the proposed model can be used to both meet demand for emergency medical services and determine the optimal location of emergency medical care facilities.},

Sustainability strategies offer significant environmental and financial benefits for healthcare organizations. This study presents an interactive optimization model for sustainable production scheduling in healthcare by considering production models for medical products with carbon. The manufacturer uses a rework tactic to repair the defective items. The shortage is not allowed because a lack of essential medicines may be expensive in terms of wasted resources, avoidable disease, and death. The model includes variable setup costs and carbon emissions from production, storage, and transportation activities, which may be reduced by green investment. This study aims to advance the expertise of sustainable production scheduling by mathematical models to look for advanced solutions that help achieve net-zero emission goals and lower costs while enhancing the patient's experience in healthcare. An iterative solution approach is applied, which is offered analytically and numerically to arrive at the optimal solutions. The results imply that the healthcare sector's outsize ecological carbon footprint can be reduced without compromising quality by designing optimal production strategies. Besides, the findings in the study confirm that green investment is the greatest economical method for reducing carbon emissions and overall healthcare system costs.},

The project objectives are identified inter alia as: placing the patient at the centre of the healthcare delivery system; improved population wellbeing; improved health service provider efficiencies; and the provision of an Electronic Health Record (EHR). The literature suggests that the achievement of these objectives can only be realised through unlocking the `meaningful use'of the vast amounts of data which these systems continue to capture and generate. In the business and corporate world, where successful data analytics adoption has supported business value creation, the approach has been to strategically manage the diffusion of an analytics culture throughout the organisation, recognising that analytics is an amalgam of technology, process, and human capital. This research assesses the level of healthcare analytics awareness and skills across an acute hospital setting in Ireland; the Saolta University Health Care Group. A survey of clinical/administrative leaders, support and technical staff was conducted with the aim of determining data analytics capacity across the Saolta group. Summary statistics provided insight into analytics competency, acquisition of that competency, and use within the speciality or role. The survey also examined the concept of an `analytics champion'as a potential driver of an analytics culture within each speciality/department. Qualitative data suggested analytics use cases, which respondents considered to be important in expanding the role of analytics at the front line. Finally, respondents'views on appropriate levels of Continuous Professional Development (CPD) around healthcare analytics education was explored. The work will contribute to the requirements of a healthcare analytics project within Saolta and expand discussions around a structured approach to healthcare analytics adoption across the acute sector in general.},

Primary articles are selected from PubMed, IEEE and WebOfScience with a search query, and then exclusion and quality assessment criteria are used to select the articles that are relevant to this study. Published performance metrics for the prediction algorithms used in the studies were then extracted from the included articles and used to assess the different methods.

The algorithms that were designed specifically for NLP such as word2vec and BERT also performed well with F1-scores of 88.93{\%} and 91.50{\%}. This review does not give a comparison between methods but gives an indication about which machine learning methods perform well according to the authors of the selected studies.

	abstract = {Pediatric asthma is a leading cause of emergency department (ED) utilization, which is expensive and often preventable. Therefore, development of ED utilization predictive models that can accurately predict patients at high-risk of frequent ED use and subsequently steering their treatment pathway towards more personalized interventions, has high clinical utility. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which deep learning models, specifically recurrent neural networks (RNNs), coupled with routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) clinical data can predict the frequency of emergency department utilization among children with asthma. We use retrospective longitudinal EHR data of 87,413 children with asthma aged 0--18 years, who were attributed to one or more healthcare facility for at least 2 consecutive years between 2000--2013. The models were trained for the task of predicting the frequency of emergency department visits in the next 12 months. We compared prediction results of three recurrent neural network (RNN) models: bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU), and reverse time attention model (RETAIN), to a baseline multinomial logistic regression model. We assessed the predictive accuracy of the models using receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC--ROC), precision--recall curve (AUC-PR), and F1-score. The results indicated that all RNN models have similar performances reaching AUC--ROC: 0.85, AUC-PR: 0.74, and F1-score: 0.61, compared to AUC--ROC: 0.81, AUC-PR: 0.69, and F1-score: 0.56 for a baseline multinomial logistic regression. Predictive models created from large routinely available EHR data using RNN models can accurately identify children with asthma at high-risk of repeated ED visits, without interacting with the patient or collecting information beyond the patient's EHR.},

	abstract = {Rural hospitals continue to face significant challenges, including declining inpatient admissions, which may have a deteriorating impact on rural hospitals'financial viability and the health care of rural residents. We use descriptive and predictive analytics to analyze trends in the average daily census (ADC), a measure of inpatient volume, and identify factors that may be associated with the ADC in Pennsylvania's rural hospitals. We use retrospective longitudinal data on Pennsylvania's rural acute care hospitals from 2000 to 2019. Overall, Pennsylvania's rural hospitals experienced a decline in ADC. Readmission index, registered nurse (RN) staffing, population over 65 years of age, and population per square mile were statistically significant and positively associated with ADC. The mortality index was statistically significant and negatively associated with ADC, and the payer mix did not seem to impact ADC. In addition, critical access hospitals (CAHs) had a statistically significant and negative association with ADC. The continuing decline in ADC may deteriorate rural hospitals'financial stability and overall health in rural communities. Hospital administrators should consider increasing nurse staffing to improve the quality of care and patient communication to build trust. Policymakers should encourage more hospitals, especially the CAHs and smaller hospitals, to participate in the Pennsylvania Rural Health Model to ensure their financial stability.},

	abstract = {Prolonged hospital stays, and readmission contribute to substantial healthcare cost. Hence, an assessment of the optimal inpatient length of stay (LOS) associated with lower readmission rate is important for healthcare providers. Post-acute care (PAC) facilities have promising potential to shorten the LOS; however, currently their influence on overall patient outcomes is not well understood. The primary goal of this study is to highlight the interrelated risk factors of LOS and readmission for cardiac patients. The study also examines the influence of PAC referral on LOS and readmission. In this paper, a cohort of 13,982 Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) and Valve Replacement (VR) patients from 49 hospitals in the U.S. were analyzed with respect to the association of healthcare delivery, demographics, PAC referral, and clinical conditions with LOS and readmission. A generalized linear mixed model and multinomial logistic regression model were developed to evaluate the readmission and LOS associative risk factors, respectively. Referral to PAC was included as a vital predictor in both models to examine its impact on optimal LOS and improving patient outcomes. The results indicate a non-uniform care distribution across census divisions and an inverse relationship between LOS and readmissions. The analytics showed that higher LOS patients were more often referred to PAC and yet they were more prone to readmission except for the patients who were referred to Long Term Care (LTC). This study identifies the effects of healthcare delivery, demographic, comorbidity, and PAC referral factors on readmission and LOS, so that personalized acute and post-acute care coordination can be achieved to improve overall patient outcomes. Interventions such as treating CABG and VR patients with multiple comorbidities for longer time in acute hospitals and increasing LTC referral can result in significant improvement.},

	abstract = {The increasing demand for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds requires efficient admission, discharge, and care processes. These efforts require predictions of Length of Stay (LOS) values; however, it is unclear how accurate these predictions need to be. This study investigates the relationship between the accuracy level of LOS predictions and operational performance indicators. A discrete event simulation model is developed to model the ICU patient flows. A linear function of actual and simulated LOS values is used to measure the accuracy level of the predictions. Multiple configurations of patient mix and patient waiting threshold were included in the simulation scenarios. Performance indicators are the average waiting time of patients for an ICU bed and overall admission ratios. Further statistical tests were carried out to evaluate the significance of the results. Results suggest that inaccurate LOS predictions overestimated both the average waiting time of patients for an ICU bed and overall admission rates which can have several quality and performance implications for hospitals. The gaps increased when more elective patients were included in the patient mix. Moreover, higher waiting thresholds (i.e., the maximum amount of time a patient will wait for an ICU bed) yielded higher values in both performance indicators.},

@phdthesis{x354,
	abstract = {The continuing growth of the older population has led to a significant increase in demand for rehabilitation over the past two decades and subsequently in long delays in admission to rehabilitation care. These delays have two important implications: Firstly, delayed patients continue occupying their beds in acute care, blocking new patients from being admitted and incurring additional costs of operating acute beds. Secondly, admission delays could adversely impact rehabilitation outcomes. In this thesis, we propose new empirical and stochastic models of patient flow and use them to develop insights and operational interventions aimed at reducing admission delays. In Chapter 2, we investigate the sources of admission delays in Low Tolerance Long Duration (LTLD) rehabilitation. Admission delays can be caused by capacity constraints or extra processing requirements to plan rehabilitation activities. However, standard data only includes a single (combined) measure of delay, and the bed allocation decisions in practice can be quite complicated with multiple determinant factors. To address these challenges, we propose a Hidden Markov Model to estimate the status-quo bed allocation policy with unobserved processing times. The estimation results are then combined with a high-fidelity queueing model of the system to evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions to reduce admission delays. In Chapter 3, we focus on High Tolerance Short Duration (HTSD) rehabilitation and investigate the causal impact of delays on rehabilitation length-of-stays (LOSs) and outcomes. By utilizing an instrumental variable approach, we find that admission delays increase the rehabilitation LOS and negatively impact the functional outcomes of the patients in rehabilitation. Finally, motivated by the empirical findings of Chapter 3, in Chapter 4, we develop approximately optimal scheduling policies for multiclass queues with wait-dependent service times. We propose a simulation-based approximate policy iteration algorithm, wherein the policy improvement step is guided through Machine Learning-based classifiers and the policy evaluation is accelerated using a coupling approach. Using extensive numerical experiments, we investigate the scalability of the proposed algorithm and further apply it in a Case Study calibrated using HTSD rehabilitation data.},

The overall aim of this thesis project is to identify and develop strategies to improve elective surgical scheduling for TKA and THA. Machine learning and optimization to predict resource utilization-related outcomes such as the duration of surgery and length of stay for arthroplasty patients were identified. A predict-then-optimize approach utilizing neural network models and linear programming was compared to historic scheduling strategies. Data sources for this work include the administrative National Surgical Quality Improvement Program and an institutional database from the Holland Centre at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. The most important features of the neural network models for outcome prediction were identified and compared between databases. Together, these findings are the foundation upon which to develop a ``smart'' surgical scheduling system and improve the efficiency of operating room utilization.},

	abstract = {With the guidance of the advanced manufacturing philosophy, green scheduling and energy efficiency have received considerable attention from enterprises and countries. Meanwhile, distributed manufacturing is becoming widespread due to the exploration of the business. Thus, this paper investigates the energy-efficient scheduling of the distributed flexible job shop problem (EEDFJSP) with the goal of minimizing the makespan and total energy consumption (TEC). Considering the difficulty of simultaneously optimizing both objectives, a knowledge-guided bi-population evolutionary algorithm (KBEA) is proposed to address this issue. Firstly, a problem-specific initialization strategy based on a four-vector representation is presented, which corresponds to four sub-problems including factory assignment, operation sequence, machine assignment, and speed assignment. Secondly, five different types of evolutionary operators with adaption strategy is designed to guide the bi-population to complete efficient evolution. Thirdly, a knowledge-guided local search strategy is used to enhance the exploitation capability of the algorithm. Furthermore, an elaborately-designed energy-saving strategy based on knowledge is developed to further reduce energy consumption. Additionally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed KBEA, extensive experiments are conducted to compare with other 7 comparison algorithms on 39 instances. Experimental results manifest that KBEA is superior to its competitors.},

After being seen in clinic, many require follow-up surgery, for which they also wait in a queue. The rate-limiting factor is physician availability for both clinic visits and surgical cases. Although much existing work has been done to optimize clinic appointments, as well as to optimize surgical appointments, this novel approach models the entire patient journey at the system level, through both clinic and surgery, to optimize the total patient experience. A discrete-event simulation model of the system was built based on historic patient encounter data and validated. The system model was then optimized to determine the best allocation of physician resources across the system to minimize total patient wait time using machine learning. The results were then compared to baseline.},

OR utilization is a crucial OR efficiency metric requiring accurate case duration estimates. The patient's age, ASA, BMI, Malampati score, previous surgery, the planned surgery, the surgeon, the assistant's level of experience, and the severity of the patient's disease are also associated with operative duration. Although complex machine learning models are accurate in operative prediction, they are not always available in resource-limited hospitals. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is one of the most common surgical procedures performed and is one of the few procedures performed at critical access and rural hospitals. The accurate estimation of the operative duration of LC is essential for efficient OR utilization. We hypothesize that a multivariate linear regression prediction model can be constructed from a set of preoperatively known, easily collected variables to maximize OR utilization and improve operative scheduling accuracy for LC. We further hypothesize that this model can be implemented in resource-limited environments, such as critical access hospitals.},

	abstract = {This project explores the implementation of process automation within a tech company to streamline and optimize the Sev ABC Rota process, which involves the manual handling of critical support tickets. The current manual system poses challenges such as data entry errors, time consumption, and delays in system updates, necessitating the urgent need for automation. Power Automate, along with connectors like Excel, Outlook, Teams, and SharePoint, is utilized to automate the Sev ABC Rota process. The automation includes creating and updating data in a SharePoint list, removing engineers from the daily queue, sending email notifications, and creating a Teams group chat. The choice of Power Automate is based on its no-code functionality and compatibility with Microsoft connectors, ensuring simplicity, time savings, and increased productivity. The paper discusses the benefits and challenges of process automation and automated workflows, emphasizing their impact on productivity, cost reduction, accuracy, and customer satisfaction. Various metrics and assessment techniques, including cycle time, throughput, error rates, cost savings, and customer satisfaction, are proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of automated workflows. Additionally, emerging trends in automation, such as the combination of cognitive technologies, adoption of intelligent automation, cloud computing, and lowcode/no-code platforms, are discussed. The importance of change management and employee engagement in successful automation implementation is highlighted, emphasizing the need for a culture of ongoing learning and collaboration. Overall, this paper provides insights into the implementation and evaluation of process automation in the tech industry, offering a roadmap for organizations seeking to enhance efficiency and optimize operations.},

The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, to position the planning decisions, a taxonomy is presented. This taxonomy provides health care managers and OR/MS researchers with a method to identify, break down and classify planning and control decisions. Second, following the taxonomy, for six health care services, we provide an exhaustive specification of planning and control decisions in resource capacity planning and control. For each planning and control decision, we structurally review the key OR/MS articles and the OR/MS methods and techniques that are applied in the literature to support decision making.},

	n2 = {To remain competitive in a highly dynamic environment, manufacturing companies have to quickly react to disturbances or changing customer requirements. To enable manufacturing systems to cover these dynamics, the concept of reconfigurable manufacturing systems was introduced. From a technical point of view, this concept has been exploited for the past 20 years, revealing several different design solutions. However, industrial application is still an exception. Our analysis led to the assumption that this is due to a lack of operator support for reconfiguration management. In addition, mostly individual aspects of reconfiguration are considered instead of exploiting the entire reconfiguration space at the system and machine level. Therefore, in this paper, we present a digital twin framework for reconfiguration management considering reconfiguration as a holistic problem. We evaluate the framework by conducting a case study and challenging it by evaluating the completeness based on a systematic literature review, and analyze if it follows good practice based on 32 requirements for digital twin frameworks.},

Multiple local search techniques are combined with NSGA-II to enhance the convergence speed and solution quality. In each generation, the algorithm selects key operations on the critical path for local search and applies the principles of minimizing costs and minimizing energy consumption to guide the local search on individuals. The optimization goals consist of reducing the longest completion time, minimizing expenses, and lowering energy usage. Experimental results on multiple instances of flexible job shop scheduling problems demonstrate that this algorithm exhibits good performance and effectiveness.},

Surgical procedures account for 40-70{\%} of hospital revenues and 30-40{\%} of total costs. Most planning and scheduling in healthcare is done without modern planning tools, which have potential for improving access by assisting in operations planning support. We identified key planning scenarios of interest to perioperative leaders, in order to examine the feasibility of applying combinatorial optimization software solving some of those planning issues in the operative setting. Perioperative leaders desire a broad range of tools for planning and assessing alternate solutions. Our modeled solutions generated feasible solutions that varied as expected, based on resource and policy assumptions and found better utilization of scarce resources. Combinatorial optimization modeling can effectively evaluate alternatives to support key decisions for planning clinical workflow and improving care efficiency and satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Home health care (HHC) is a fast-growing area of research that has received increasing attention in recent years due to the rise in life expectancy and the fall in birth rates. It is expected to reduce length of stay in hospital as well as to allow patients to receive care and assistance in their home. Several models and algorithms have been proposed to manage the various constraints and criteria. However, multi-objectives HHC routing and scheduling problems (HHCRSP) with practical and complicated constraints as well as Pareto dominance based approaches are still scarce in the literature. In this paper, we focus on modeling and solving the multi-objectives HHCRSP with lunch breaks, multiple time windows, duty length, skill requirement and a mix of soft and hard services. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model with three objectives is proposed, which aims to minimize tardiness of soft services and caregivers'waiting times and also to balance their workload. Two approaches, Pareto and decomposition based, with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are proposed to solve the multi-objective HHCRSP. We developed a memetic algorithm (NSGA-LS), resulting from the hybridization of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) with multidirectional local search (MDLS), to trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Computational results and performance measures inferred that NSGA-LS has a better performance compared to other algorithms. According to the hyper-volume indicator, NSGA-LS obtained 93.75{\%} better solutions for the tested instances in a pairwise comparison between algorithms while multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) has a better complexity. Sensitivity analysis of the percentage of soft/flexible services and the maximum allowed tardiness showed that increasing them significantly improved the quality and trade-off of solutions.},

	abstract = {In the context of Industry 4.0 and intelligent manufacturing, AGVs are widely used in flexible job shop resource transportation, which sharply increases the uncertainty and complexity of the scheduling process. For this reason, an improved double Deep Q Network (DDQN) real-time scheduling method is proposed for the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem with Automated Guided Vehicle (FJSP-AGV) to minimize the makespan. Firstly, the optimization model of the FJSP-AGV is established, and the corresponding constraints and the objective function are defined. Then, the FJSP-AGV is converted into a Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which the state space, action space, and reward function are defined in detail. Next, an improved DDQN is proposed to generate the optimal scheduling policy considering AGV. Finally, the computational experiments are conducted based on data from public benchmarks and the real-world flexible job shop, and the results demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

	abstract = {The environmental-friendly production demands higher manufacturing efficiency and lower energy cost; therefore, time-of-use electricity price constraint and distributed production have attracted more attention. For concrete precast architecture construction, the tardiness penalty and warehouse cost cannot be ignored, which should be optimized for lower cost. In this study, the concrete precast process is investigated as the group scheduling of a distributed flexible job shop problem. Each concrete precast is managed in a group, the setup time between different groups is considered. Two objectives, total weighted earliness and tardiness and total time-of-use electricity cost are minimized, simultaneously. To solve the integrated problem, three coordinated double deep Q-networks (DQN) are applied, which are organized as a learn-to-improve reinforcement learning approach. For distributed scheduling problem, operators in a single factory or in multiple factories differs in solution improvement; so selection DQN is designed to decide the type of the operators according to scheduling circumstances. Other two DQNs, i.e., local DQN and global DQN, are to select the optimization operators in one factory or in multiple factories, respectively. Furthermore, two solution refinement strategies are designed to decrease the objectives after reinforcement learning component. Numerical experiment and statistical analysis suggest that the proposed deep reinforcement learning based algorithm has superiority in solving the considered problem.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a machine learning-augmented General Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm, termed Self-adaptive General Variable Neighborhood Search (SGVNS), for solving the two-identical parallel machine scheduling problem with unrelated servers. The studied problem is of high practical relevance in various industries and presents a significant gap in the existing literature. The motivation for this study stems from the healthcare industry, specifically surgery scheduling with limited anesthesiologists'availability. Two mathematical formulations are presented to solve this scheduling problem. However, these formulations are limited to small-scale problems, prompting the need for an efficient metaheuristic. Therefore, a novel variant of the General Variable Neighborhood Search metaheuristic is developed, incorporating a self-adaption mechanism based on an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted to assess the performance of the SGVNS metaheuristic on various classes of instances. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SGVNS in solving previously unsolved small-sized instances, outperforming both formulations while maintaining reasonable computation times.},
