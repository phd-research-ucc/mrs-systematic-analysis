The objectives are to maximize the utilization of the operating rooms, to minimize the overtime-operating cost, and to minimize the wasting cost for the unused time. To begin with, a revised mathematical model is constructed to assign surgeries to operating rooms within one week. Then, we proposed four easy-to-implement heuristics that can guarantee to find feasible solutions for the studied problem efficiently. Furthermore, we presented four local search procedures that can improve a given solution significantly. Finally, a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) that incorporated with initial solutions, local search procedures and elite search procedure is applied to the studied problem. Computational results show that for small problem instances, the HGA can find near optimal solutions efficiently while for large problem instances, the HGA performs significantly better than the four proposed heuristics. We concluded that surgery schedules obtained by using HGA has less wasting cost for the unused time, much higher utilization of operating rooms, and produce less overtime-operating cost.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

GORPS allocates elective patients and resources (i.e., operating rooms, surgeons, anesthetists) to days, assigns resources to patients, and sequences patients in each day. We consider patients' due-date, resource eligibility, heterogeneous performances of resources, downstream unit requirements, and lag times between resources. The goal is to create a weekly surgery schedule that minimizes fixed- and over-time costs. We model GORPS using mixed-integer and constraint programming models. To efficiently and effectively solve these models, we develop new` multi-featured logic-based Benders decomposition approaches. Using data from TGH, we demonstrate that our best algorithm solves GORPS with an average optimality gap of 2.71% which allows us to provide our practical recommendations. First, we can increase daily OR utilization to reach 80%---25% higher than the status quo in TGH. Second, we do not require to optimize for the daily selection of anesthetists---this finding allows for the development of effective dominance rules that significantly mitigate intractability. Third, solving GORPS without downstream capacities (like many papers in literature) makes GORPS easier to solve, but such OR schedules are only feasible in 24% of instances. Finally, with existing ORs' safety capacities, TGH can manage 40% increase in its surgical volumes. We provide recommendations on how TGH must adjust its downstream capacities for varying levels of surgical volume increases (e.g., current urgent need for more capacity due to the current Covid-19 pandemic).","Healthcare operations, planning and scheduling, operating rooms, multiple resources, performance heterogeneity, overtime, downstream capacities, logic-based Benders decomposition","","","","","","","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/poms.13397","","","",""

We consider several aspects in the model of this research, including the number of operating rooms, working hours, the available number of anesthetic machines, and utilization of each room. We propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to solve the operating room scheduling problem and based on the model, a decision support system (DSS) is developed to allow the hospital generates a better schedule with a shorter time.

They are a primary source of revenue and are often seen as one of the bottlenecks in the medical system. Many efforts are made to increase throughput, reduce costs, and maximize incomes, as well as optimize clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. We trained a predictive model on the length of surgeries to improve the productivity and utility of operative rooms in general hospitals. Methods: We collected clinical and administrative data for the last 10 years from two large general public hospitals in Israel. We trained a machine learning model to give the expected length of surgery using pre-operative data. These data included diagnoses, laboratory tests, risk factors, demographics, procedures, anesthesia type, and the main surgeon’s level of experience. We compared our model to a naïve model that represented current practice. Findings: Our prediction model achieved better performance than the naïve model and explained almost 70% of the variance in surgery durations. Interpretation: A machine learning-based model can be a useful approach for increasing operating room utilization. Among the most important factors were the type of procedures and the main surgeon’s level of experience. The model enables the harmonizing of hospital productivity through wise scheduling and matching suitable teams for a variety of clinical procedures for the benefit of the individual patient and the system as a whole.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since operating room planning is a major problem in healthcare organizations, the optimization of medical staff and equipment plays an essential role. Thus, this study presents a multi-objective mathematical model with a new categorization (preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative) to minimize operating room scheduling and the risk of using equipment. Time constraints in healthcare systems and medical equipment limited capacity are the most significant considered limitation in the present study. In this regard, since the duration of patient preparation and implementation of treatment processes occur in three states of optimistic, pessimistic, and normal, the introduced parameters are examined relying on a fuzzy uncertainty analysis of the problem. Hence, the model is measured in a real numerical solution sample in a medical center to evaluate and confirm the proposed mathematical model. Then, two meta-heuristic algorithms (NRGA and NSGAII) are implemented on the mathematical model to analyze the proposed model.

There is paucity of data in India on the use of available operating time and the reasons for less-than-optimal utilization have not been studied. METHODS: This audit was done prospectively over a period of 12 months in the department of general surgery, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Pondicherry. Operation theatre utilization was studied with respect to the starting and closing of the operation theatre, interval between surgical procedures, cancellation of surgical procedures and reasons thereof. RESULTS: The operation theatre was functional for 279 days during the year of the study, and 1773 cases were operated (6.3 cases per day). The total operating time utilized was 91.5%. The major reasons for cancellation of a total of 310 cases were lack of operating time (65.2%), emergency surgery during the elective list (13.9%), and preoperative lack of fitness (11.3%). Among all the lists, 43.6% started late and 63.6% of lists finished well before the scheduled closing time. Absence of monitoring equipment and non-availability of additional qualified anaesthetists necessitated induction of anaesthesia in the main operating room and accounted for 11% of the total operating time. CONCLUSION: Delay in starting lists, under-scheduling, interruption due to emergency surgeries, administrative reasons, induction of anaesthesia and recovery policies are the main factors that account for inefficient use of operating facilities. The correction of these factors would increase the available operating time by nearly 20%.","","","","eng","","","","","","","",""

In surgery, estimates for the cost of 1 minute of operating room (OR) time vary widely. No benchmark exists for the cost of OR time, nor has there been a comprehensive assessment of what contributes to OR cost.To calculate the cost of 1 minute of OR time, assess cost by setting and facility characteristics, and ascertain the proportion of costs that are direct and indirect.This cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis examined annual financial disclosure documents from all comparable short-term general and specialty care hospitals in California from fiscal year (FY) 2005 to FY2014 (N = 3044; FY2014, n = 302). The analysis focused on 2 revenue centers: (1) surgery and recovery and (2) ambulatory surgery.Mean cost of 1 minute of OR time, stratified by setting (inpatient vs ambulatory), teaching status, and hospital ownership. The proportion of cost attributable to indirect and direct expenses was identified; direct expenses were further divided into salary, benefits, supplies, and other direct expenses.In FY2014, a total of 175 of 302 facilities (57.9%) were not for profit, 78 (25.8%) were for profit, and 49 (16.2%) were government owned. Thirty facilities (9.9%) were teaching hospitals. The mean (SD) cost for 1 minute of OR time across California hospitals was \$37.45 (\$16.04) in the inpatient setting and \$36.14 (\$19.53) in the ambulatory setting (P = .65). There were no differences in mean expenditures when stratifying by ownership or teaching status except that teaching hospitals had lower mean (SD) expenditures than nonteaching hospitals in the inpatient setting (\$29.88 [\$9.06] vs \$38.29 [\$16.43]; P = .006). Direct expenses accounted for 54.6% of total expenses (\$20.40 of \$37.37) in the inpatient setting and 59.1% of total expenses (\$20.90 of \$35.39) in the ambulatory setting. Wages and benefits accounted for approximately two-thirds of direct expenses (inpatient, \$14.00 of \$20.40; ambulatory, \$14.35 of \$20.90), with nonbillable supplies accounting for less than 10% of total expenses (inpatient, \$2.55 of \$37.37; ambulatory, \$3.33 of \$35.39). From FY2005 to FY2014, expenses in the OR have increased faster than the consumer price index and medical consumer price index. Teaching hospitals had slower growth in costs than nonteaching hospitals. Over time, the proportion of expenses dedicated to indirect costs has increased, while the proportion attributable to salary and supplies has decreased.The mean cost of OR time is \$36 to \$37 per minute, using financial data from California's short-term general and specialty hospitals in FY2014. These statewide data provide a generalizable benchmark for the value of OR time. Furthermore, understanding the composition of costs will allow those interested in value improvement to identify high-yield targets.","","","","","","","","https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/articlepdf/2673385/jamasurgery_childers_2018_oi_170128.pdf","","","",""

We consider a MSSP where elective and emergency patients can be treated in the same operating rooms.

To solve the MSSP, we propose a simulation-optimization approach consisting of a two-stage stochastic optimization model and a discrete-event simulation model. For the two-stage stochastic optimization model, uncertain arrivals of emergency patients are represented by discrete scenarios. The discrete-event simulation model is developed to address uncertainty related to the surgery duration and the length of stay at the hospital, and to test the Master Surgery Schedule (MSS) developed by the optimization model in a stochastic operational-level environment. In addition, the simulation model is used to generate scenarios for the optimization model. We present some general advice for surgery scheduling based on testing the optimization model in a numerical study. The simulation-optimization approach is applied to a case study from a hospital department that treats both elective and emergency patients. The optimized MSS outperforms the manually generated MSS, both in terms of emergency waiting time for surgery, and emergency interruptions to the flow of electives.","OR in health services, Master Surgery Scheduling, Stochastic programming, Discrete-event simulation","","","","","","","","","","",""

When the population is afflicted in various regions, scheduling a fair and acceptable distribution of limited available resources stored in multiple emergency resource centers to each epidemic area has become a serious problem that requires immediate resolution.MethodsThis study presents an emergency medical logistics model for rapid response to public health emergencies. The proposed methodology consists of two recursive mechanisms: (1) time-varying forecasting of medical resources and (2) emergency medical resource allocation. Considering the epidemic's features and the heterogeneity of existing medical treatment capabilities in different epidemic areas, we provide the modified susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to predict the early stage emergency medical resource demand for epidemics. Then we define emergency indicators for each epidemic area based on this. By maximizing the weighted demand satisfaction rate and minimizing the total vehicle travel distance, we develop a bi-objective optimization model to determine the optimal medical resource allocation plan.ResultsDecision-makers should assign appropriate values to parameters at various stages of the emergency process based on the actual situation, to ensure that the results obtained are feasible and effective. It is necessary to set up an appropriate number of supply points in the epidemic emergency medical logistics supply to effectively reduce rescue costs and improve the level of emergency services.ConclusionsOverall, this work provides managerial insights to improve decisions made on medical distribution as per demand forecasting for quick response to public health emergencies.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The government responded to the first wave with a strict nationwide lockdown which disrupted primary care, including the management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The second wave overwhelmed healthcare facilities leading to inadequate access to hospital services. Collectively, these issues required urgent responses, including the adaptation of primary care.ApproachThe Low-Cost Effective Care Unit (LCECU) of Christian Medical College, Vellore (CMC) has a network of community volunteers, community health workers, an outreach nurse, social workers and doctors who operate clinics in six poorer areas of Vellore. The network adapted quickly, responding to the lockdown during the first wave and ensuring ongoing primary care for patients with non-communicable diseases. During the second wave, the team developed a system in collaboration with other CMC departments to provide home-based care for patients with COVID-19.Local settingThe LCECU is a 48-bed unit of the Department of Family Medicine, part of the 3,000-bed CMC. It originated in 1982, aiming to care for the poor populations of Vellore town. It has been actively working among urban communities since 2002, with a focus on delivering Community Oriented Primary Care (COPC), for six poor urban communities since 2016.Relevant changesDuring the first wave of COVID the LCECU team ensured patients with NCDs had uninterrupted primary care and medications by visiting them in their homes. The team also addressed food insecurity by organizing a daily lunch service for 600 people for over 2 months. In the second wave, the team responded to community needs by organizing and delivering home-based care to monitor patients affected by COVID-19.Lessons learnedThe COVID-19 pandemic raises many questions about the preparedness of health systems for disasters that disproportionately affect marginalized populations globally. COVID-19 is only one of the many potential disasters, including non-communicable diseases, mental health problems, pollution, climate change, and lifestyle illness. There is an urgent need to study models of care that support vulnerable communities in an accessible, cost-effective, and patient-oriented way, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This paper outlines lessons on how the LCECU team addressed disaster management:1. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of primary care-based rapid response interventions in disaster management.2. The LCECU model demonstrated the effectiveness of a primary care intervention based on pre-existing networks and familiarity between primary care teams and the community.3. Establishing community-based health care via interdisciplinary teams, including community health workers, community volunteers, outreach nurses, and doctors, is key.4. Addressing other social determinants of health, such as food insecurity, is an important component of care delivery.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, we do sensitivity analyses of hospital level, in-hospital disease cross-infection, and resource allocation to get the least costly strategy and to provide operational guidance.

The paper considers a novel distributed operating room scheduling problem (DORSP), in which elective patients planned on a given day are scheduled for surgeries in the distributed operating rooms of collaborative hospitals. Since hospitals are different in terms of specialization and medical expertise, some complicated surgeries in this problem can only be performed in a subset of collaborative hospitals. Based on the similarities between healthcare delivery systems and production systems, DORSP is modelled as a distributed two-stage no-wait hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with factory eligibility. To deal with the NP-hardness of DORSP, an adaptive-learning-based genetic algorithm (ALBGA) is proposed to generate collaborative surgery schedules. In addition to traditional genetic operators, ALBGA also applies an adaptive learning operator to enhance the search ability by mimicking human learning behaviours. Computational results on both small-sized and large-sized test problems show that ALBGA is competitive among the compared algorithms.","Scheduling, Distributed operating rooms, Hybrid flow shop, Genetic algorithm, Adaptive learning","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because of its importance, the operating room scheduling problem has been addressed from many different perspectives since the early 1960s. One of the main difficulties that has reduced the applicability of the current results is the high variability in surgery duration, making schedule recommendations hard to implement. In this work, we propose a time-indexed scheduling formulation to solve the operational problem. Our main contribution is that we propose the use of chance constraints related to the surgery duration's probability distribution for each surgeon to improve the scheduling performance. We show how to implement these chance constraints as linear ones in our time-indexed formulation, enhancing the performance of the resulting schedules significantly. Through data analysis of real historical instances, we develop specific constraints that improve the schedule, reducing the need for overtime without affecting the utilization significantly. Furthermore, these constraints give the operating room manager the possibility of balancing overtime and utilization through a tuning parameter in our formulation. Finally, through simulations and the use of real instances, we report the performance for four different metrics, showing the importance of using historical data to get the right balance between the utilization and overtime.","Scheduling, OR in health services, Operating room scheduling, Scheduling under uncertainty","","","","","","","","","","",""

As well as three objectives of maximum completion time, total energy consumption, and average agreement index are demonstrated in this study.

In the proposed algorithm, an active decoding heuristic based on the interval insertion mechanism is used to optimize the initial solutions. After that, the clonal selection-based immune algorithm and the Q-learning algorithm are adopted to improve the exploration and exploitation capabilities, respectively, where four objective-driven neighborhood structures are designed. Eventually, extensive computational experiments were conducted on 27 instances under static and dynamic scenarios to demonstrate the superiority and stability of the proposed predictive-reactive dynamic/static rescheduling model and the Q-MOIA. Comparative analysis with four state-of-the-art approaches revealed that proposed Q-MOIA outperformed in approximately 51.9, 66.7, and 83.3 % of the instances for the three multi-objective metrics.","Flexible job shop scheduling problem, Fuzzy processing time, Dynamic disruptions, Predictive-reactive dynamic/static rescheduling model, Multi-objective immune algorithm, -learning algorithm","","","","","","","","","","",""

HHC gains importance due to the increasing epidemic disease cases, the increase in the elderly population, etc. In this study, it is aimed to provide high quality service as well as minimizing travel costs by considering the constraints related to travel balancing and type of transportation vehicle. So, environmental and economic factors could be included in the model. The proposed Home Health Care Routing Problem with Health Team Skill Level (HTSL-HHCRP) model was coded in GAMS 24.2.1 software. A new hybrid method named as Genetic Algorithm Simulated Annealing-Marine Predators Algorithm (GASA-MPA) has been developed to solve the large dimensions of the problem. In hybrid approach, SA has been used with an initial point obtained by GA. On the other hand, feasibility of the neighborhood solutions is guaranteed by solving a constraint satisfaction problem via MPA. Test problems'performance was analyzed using the Relative Deviation Index (RDI) evaluation criteria. In addition, the sensitivity of the results according to some parameters selected by scenario analysis was examined. Results confirm the efficiency of the GASA-MPA algorithm in terms of time and objective function.

Although the dynamic SDR selection classifier (DSSC) mined by traditional data-mining-based scheduling method has shown some improvement in comparison to an SDR, the enhancement is not significant since the rule selected by DSSC is still an SDR. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a novel data-mining-based scheduling method for the DJSP with machine failure aiming at minimizing the makespan. Firstly, a scheduling priority relation model (SPRM) is constructed to determine the appropriate priority relation between two operations based on the production system state and the difference between their priority values calculated using multiple SDRs. Subsequently, a training sample acquisition mechanism based on the optimal scheduling schemes is proposed to acquire training samples for the SPRM. Furthermore, feature selection and machine learning are conducted using the genetic algorithm and extreme learning machine to mine the SPRM. Findings Results from numerical experiments demonstrate that the SPRM, mined by the proposed method, not only achieves better scheduling results in most manufacturing environments but also maintains a higher level of stability in diverse manufacturing environments than an SDR and the DSSC. Originality/value This paper constructs a SPRM and mines it based on data mining technologies to obtain better results than an SDR and the DSSC in various manufacturing environments.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cloud computing's performance may need more effective resource planning. Resources must be distributed equally among all relevant stakeholders to maintain the group's profit and the satisfaction of its consumers. Since these essential resources are unavailable on the board, a client request cannot be put on hold forever. To address these issues, a hybrid machine learning technique for resource allocation security with effective task scheduling in cloud computing is proposed in this study. Initially, a short scheduler for tasks built around the enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (IPSO-TS) reduces make-span time and increases throughput. Next, bandwidth and resource load are included in a Graph Attention Neural Network (GANN) for effective resource allocation under various design limitations. Finally, NSUPREME, a simple identification technique, is suggested for the encryption process to secure data storage. The proposed method is finally simulated using various simulation settings to demonstrate its effectiveness, and the outcomes are contrasted with those of cutting-edge approaches. The findings indicate that the suggested plan is more efficient than the current one regarding resource use, power usage, responsiveness, etc.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the landscape of AI and ML use in scheduling optimization is unclear. We aimed to systematically summarize up-to-date evidence about application of AI and ML models for scheduling optimization in clinical settings. Methods We systematically searched multiple databases from inception through August 2020 to identify studies that described real-world application of AI and ML in health care scheduling and reported outcomes. Eligible studies included those conducted in any health care setting using ML or predictive modeling through AI to optimize patient scheduling processes in real-time, real-world settings. Outcomes of interest included assessing impact on stakeholders (ie, providers, patients, health systems), including impact on workload, burden, burnout, cost, utilization, patient and provider satisfaction, waste reduction, and quality. Data were extracted and reviewed in duplicates, independently and blindly by two reviewers. The results were synthesized and summarized using a metanarrative approach. Results The initial search strategy yielded 3,415 citations, of which 11 eligible studies were included. Outcome measures for studies on missed appointments covered patient double-booking volume, missed appointments, service use, and missed appointment risk. Resource allocation outcomes assessed wait time, disease-type matching performance, schedule efficiency revenue, and new patient volume wait time. Other outcomes included visit requests, examination length prediction, and surgical case time. Conclusions Available evidence shows heterogeneity in the stages of AI and ML development as they apply to patient scheduling. AI and ML applications can be used to decrease the burden on provider time, increase patient satisfaction, and ultimately provide more patient-directed health care and efficiency for medical practices. These findings help identify additional opportunities in which AI platforms can be developed to optimize patient scheduling. Public Interest Summary Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can help many aspects of health care. Patient scheduling has significant implications for the cost benefits of improved technology. The long-standing use of technology in medicine serves as a strong foundation for future AI applications. Here, we present an up-to-date review of the current use of AI and ML for schedule optimization in the health care clinic setting. Current evidence shows a wide variety of stages in the development, function, and application of AI and ML in patient scheduling. Given the current gaps of knowledge, future studies should address feasibility, effectiveness, generalizability, and risk of AI bias in patient scheduling.","appointments and schedules; artificial intelligence; decision support systems --clinical; machine learning; patient care; resource allocation","","","","","","","","","","",""

Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role in enhancing healthcare management, providing tools for outbreak prediction, resource optimization, patient triage, and beyond. AI algorithms are capable of analyzing extensive data sets from diverse sources for disease surveillance and outbreak prediction, offering valuable insights for risk assessment and enabling better preparedness. They also contribute to efficient supply chain management and optimize staff allocation by forecasting demand for medical supplies and identifying areas with the most critical needs. AI-powered symptom checkers and triage prioritization systems improve patient flow, while telemedicine, supported by remote monitoring and virtual assistants, reduces hospital congestion. AI aids in infection control through effective contact tracing and sterilization scheduling. Furthermore, AI supports clinical decision-making by providing diagnostic assistance and personalized treatment planning. Acceleration of research is another domain where AI is invaluable, expediting drug discovery and streamlining the design of clinical trials. Information dissemination, crucial during pandemics, is enhanced by AI's ability to tailor communication and combat misinformation. AI also offers support for mental health through counseling services and safeguards data privacy and cybersecurity amidst the increased reliance on digital health data. The full potential of AI in managing healthcare during pandemics is contingent upon the quality and accessibility of data, the seamless integration of AI with current healthcare IT infrastructures, and the strict adherence to ethical standards, ensuring privacy and equitable healthcare delivery.$$","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Making use of storage devices and scheduling consumers to times when energy is available allows to increase the amount of renewable energy that can be used. For this purpose, adequate models for forecasting the energy generated and consumed as well as for the behavior of storage devices are essential. Many data-based modeling approaches are computationally costly and therefore difficult to apply in real-world systems. Hence we present a computationally efficient modeling approach using a least-squares regression. Besides, we propose to use a hybrid model approach and evaluate it on real-world data at the examples of modeling the state of charge of a battery storage and the temperature inside a milk cooling tank. The experiments indicate that the hybrid approach leads to better forecasting results, especially for modeling more complicated behavior. Also, it is investigated if the behavior of the models is qualitatively realistic and we find that the battery model fulfills this requirement and is thus suitable for the application in a smart energy management system. Even though forecasts for the hybrid milk cooling model have even lower error values than the ones for the battery storage, further steps need to be taken to avoid undesired effects when using this model in such a sophisticated system.","","","","","Proceedings","","","","","62-73","",""

Using such a representation as input to Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches may reduce learning time, enable domain transfer or improve interpretability of the model. However, current state-of-the-art approaches that combine VAE with RL fail at learning good performing policies on certain RL domains. Typically, the VAE is pre-trained in isolation and may omit the embedding of task-relevant features due to insufficiencies of its loss. As a result, the RL approach can not successfully maximize the reward on these domains. Therefore, this paper investigates the issues of joint training approaches and explores incorporation of policy gradients from RL into the VAE's latent space to find a task-specific latent space representation. We show that using pre-trained representations can lead to policies being unable to learn any rewarding behaviour in these environments. Subsequently, we introduce two types of models which overcome this deficiency by using policy gradients to learn the representation. Thereby the models are able to embed features into its representation that are crucial for performance on the RL task but would not have been learned with previous methods.","","","","","Proceedings","","","","","115-131","",""

The demand is influenced by the price and freshness of the product. The conventional tabular Q-learning method involves storing the Q-values for each state-action pair in a lookup table. This approach is not suitable for control problems with large state spaces. Hence, we use function approximation approach to address the limitations of a tabular Q-learning method.

The automatic synthesis of BNs is still a challenge for which several approaches have been proposed. In this paper, we propose ASKeD-BN, a new approach based on Answer-Set Programming to synthesise BNs constrained in their structure and dynamics. By applying our method on several well-known biological systems, we provide empirical evidence that our approach can construct BNs in line with the provided constraints. We compare our approach with three existing methods (REVEAL, Best-Fit and caspo-TS) and show that our approach synthesises a small number of BNs which are covering a good proportion of the dynamical constraints, and that the variance of this coverage is low.","","","","","Proceedings","","","","","156-170","",""

However, many practical optimization problems can not be split into disjoint components. Most of them can be seen as interconnected components that share some variables with other ones. Such problems composed of parts that overlap each other are called overlapping problems. This paper proposes a modified cooperative co-evolutionary framework allowing to deal with non-disjoint subproblems in order to decompose and optimize overlapping problems efficiently. The proposed algorithm performs a new decomposition based on differential grouping to detect overlapping variables. A new cooperation strategy is also introduced to manage variables shared among several components.

With regard to this, we firstly propose a FJSP with discrete operation sequence flexibility (FJSPDS) aiming at minimizing the makespan and total energy consumption, simultaneously. An effective mathematical model is established for the FJSPDS and its validity is proved by the CPLEX; and then an improved memetic algorithm (IMA) is designed to solve the FJSPDS. In the IMA, a new flexible sequencing method for determining process plan of each job and a right-leaning decoding method are proposed. And some effective crossover and mutation operators and an effective local search operator are designed to accelerate the convergence speed and expand the solution space of the algorithm. A total of 110 FJSPDS benchmark instances are constructed to conduct numerical simulation experiments. Experimental results show that our proposed IMA has superior performance in almost all of the instances compared with three well-known evolutionary algorithms.

The research aligns with MST's objectives of sustainability, care quality, education, and scientific advancements. The Dutch government's ambitious targets to reduce CO2 emissions further emphasize the need for energy-efficient healthcare facilities. The study focuses on the scheduling problem associated with the CT scanners and utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation approach implemented in Excel VBA. Two key heuristics, namely the Longest-Expected-Processing-Time-first (LEPT) and Shortest-Expected-Processing-Time-first (SEPT) algorithms, are employed to minimize the total makespan. The simulation generates scan requests and their corresponding processing times, and the results demonstrate that implementing LEPT leads to a 26% improvement in average completion times compared to the current scheduling system. This improvement translates into a potential annual reduction of 16473 kWh in energy consumption, equivalent to the average energy consumption of three three-person households per year in the Netherlands. The research findings highlight the potential of connecting data with the CT scheduling system to improve energy efficiency, reduce CO2 emissions, and create a more sustainable hospital environment. The study contributes to the scientific understanding of scheduling in stochastic environments and provides practical insights for healthcare facilities seeking to optimize energy consumption and scheduling algorithms.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Digital appointment self-scheduling provides convenience, but utilization has been low. The purpose of this study was to develop a ``frictionless''scheduling tool and evaluate the impact on utilization. The existing institutional radiology scheduling app was configured to accommodate a frictionless workflow. A recommendation engine used patient residence, past and future appointment data to generate three optimal appointment suggestions. For eligible frictionless orders, recommendations were sent in a text message. Other orders received either a text message for the non-frictionless app scheduling approach or a call-to-schedule text. Scheduling rates by type of text message and scheduling workflow were analyzed. Baseline data for a 3-month period prior to the launch of frictionless scheduling showed that 17% of orders that received an order notification text were scheduled using the app. In an 11-month period after the launch of frictionless scheduling, the rate of app scheduling was greater for orders that received a text message with recommendations (frictionless approach) versus app schedulable orders that received a text without recommendations (29% vs. 14%, p < 0.01). Thirty-nine percent of the orders that received a frictionless text and scheduled using the app used a recommendation. The most common recommendation rules chosen for scheduling included location preference of prior appointments (52%). Among appointments that were scheduled using a day or time preference, 64% were based on a rule using the time of the day. This study showed that frictionless scheduling was associated with an increased rate of app scheduling.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In operating room planning, the allocation of patients to operating rooms and their sequencing are critical in determining the performance of operating rooms. In this paper, three surgery scheduling decisions are considered, including the number of operating rooms to open, the allocation of surgeries to operating rooms, and the sequencing of surgeries in allocated operating rooms. All the surgeries under consideration are elective, and surgery durations are considered deterministic. Further, it is considered that the surgeries have different specialties, and each operating room can accommodate a particular specialty of surgeries, i.e., heterogeneous operating rooms are considered in the current study. Before performing a surgery, setup time is required for operating room turnover and sterilization, and it is considered sequence dependent. A mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is developed to minimize the overtime costs of operating rooms for allocation and surgery sequencing with sequence dependent setup times. An outer approximation (OA) method is proposed to solve the problem near optimally. Experiments are conducted to compare the performance of the proposed OA method with the standard mixed integer nonlinear programming model. Computational results show the efficiency of the proposed OA method. Later, a case data from a case hospital is collected and a case study is solved.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effective use of operating theatres by optimal scheduling could help mitigate this, but this requires accurate case duration predictions. Current standards for predicting the duration of surgery are inaccurate. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers the potential for greater accuracy in predicting surgical case duration. This study aimed to investigate whether there is evidence to support that AI is more accurate than current industry standards at predicting surgical case duration, with a secondary aim of analysing whether the implementation of the models used produced efficiency savings.PubMed, Embase, and MEDLINE libraries were searched through to July 2023 to identify appropriate articles. PRISMA extension for scoping reviews and the Arksey and O'Malley framework were followed. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the reporting guidelines for surgical AI papers by Farrow et al. Algorithm performance was reported using evaluation metrics.The search identified 2593 articles: 14 were suitable for inclusion and 13 reported on the accuracy of AI algorithms against industry standards, with seven demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in prediction accuracy (P < 0.05). The larger studies demonstrated the superiority of neural networks over other machine learning techniques. Efficiency savings were identified in a RCT. Significant methodological limitations were identified across most studies.The studies suggest that machine learning and deep learning models are more accurate at predicting the duration of surgery; however, further research is required to determine the best way to implement this technology.","","","","","","","","https://academic.oup.com/bjsopen/article-pdf/7/6/zrad113/52824334/zrad113.pdf","","","",""

One of the more known frameworks is Dask, a widely utilized distributed framework used for parallelizing data processing jobs. In Dask, the main component that traverses and plans out the execution of the job is the scheduler. Dask utilizes a centralized scheduling approach, having a single server node as the scheduler. With no failover mechanism implemented for the scheduler, the work in progress is potentially lost if the scheduler fails. As a consequence, jobs that might have been executed for hours or longer need to be restarted. In this thesis, a highly available scheduler is designed, based on Dask. We introduce a highly-available scheduler that replicates the state of the job on a distributed key-value store. The replicated schedulers allow us to design an architecture where the schedulers are able to take over the job in case of a scheduler failure. To reduce the performance overhead of replication, we further explore optimizations based on partitioning typical task graphs and sending each partition to its own scheduler. The results show that the replicated scheduler is able to tolerate server failures and is able to complete the job without restarting but at a cost of reduced throughput due to the replication. This is mitigated by our partitioning, which achieves almost linear performance gains relative to our baseline fault-tolerant scheduler, through the utilization of a parallelized scheduling architecture.","Distributed Scheduling; Fault-tolerance; Graph Partitioning; Task Graphs; Dask; Dask Distributed; Data Processing; Distribuerad Schemaläggning; Feltolerans; Grafpartitionering; Uppgiftsgrafer; Dask; Dask Distributed; Dataprocessering; Computer and Information Sciences; Data- och informationsvetenskap","2023-11-02T18:10:39.416+01:00","","","Ph.D. Thesis","","","","","","",""

MCPS isa life-critical, context-aware, networked system of medical equipment. It has been challenging to achieve high assurance in system software, interoperability, context-aware intelligence, autonomy, security and privacy, and device certifiability due to the necessity to create complicated MCPS that are safe and efficient. The MCPS system is shown in the paper as a newly developed application case study of artificial intelligence in healthcare. Applications for various CPS-based healthcare systems are discussed, such as telehealthcare systems for managing chronic diseases (cardiovascular diseases, epilepsy, hearing loss, and respiratory diseases), supporting medication intake management, and tele-homecare systems. The goal of this study is to provide a thorough overview of the essential components of the MCPS from several angles, including design, methodology, and important enabling technologies, including sensor networks, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and multi-agent systems. Additionally, some significant applications are investigated, such as smart cities, which are regarded as one of the key applications that will offer new services for industrial systems, transportation networks, energy distribution, monitoring of environmental changes, business and commerce applications, emergency response, and other social and recreational activities.The four levels of an MCPS's general architecture---data collecting, data aggregation, cloud processing, and action---are shown in this study. Different encryption techniques must be employed to ensure data privacy inside each layer due to the variations in hardware and communication capabilities of each layer. We compare established and new encryption techniques based on how well they support safe data exchange, secure computing, and secure storage. Our thorough experimental study of each method reveals that, although enabling innovative new features like secure sharing and safe computing, developing encryption approaches significantly increases computational and storage overhead. To increase the usability of newly developed encryption schemes in an MCPS and to provide a comprehensive list of tools and databases to assist other researchers, we provide a list of opportunities and challenges for incorporating machine intelligence-based MCPS in healthcare applications in our paper's conclusion.","Medical cyber-physical systems; Internet of things; Big data; CPS Architectures; Digital twin; Dew computing; Security and privacy","","","","","","","","","","",""

We construct a fairness index using an improved Gini coefficient by considering the demand for emergency medical supplies (EMS), actual distribution, and the degree of emergency at disaster sites. We developed a bi-objective optimisation model with a minimum Gini index and scheduling time. We employ a heterogeneous ant colony algorithm to solve the Pareto boundary based on reinforcement learning. A reinforcement learning mechanism is introduced to update and exchange pheromones among populations, with reward factors set to adjust pheromones and improve algorithm convergence speed. The effectiveness of the algorithm for a large EMSS problem is verified by comparing its comprehensive performance against a super-large capacity evaluation index. Results demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in reducing convergence time and facilitating escape from local optima in EMSS problems. The algorithm addresses the issue of demand differences at each disaster point affecting fair distribution. This study optimises early-stage EMSS schemes for public health events to minimise losses and casualties while mitigating emotional distress among disaster victims.","","doi: 10.1080/00207543.2023.2267680","","","","","","","","","",""

In this journey, to meet hyper-scale growth, some business groups resorted to managing their own compute infrastructure stack running different scheduling systems such as Kubernetes, YARN which created two major pain points: the increasing resource fragmentation across different business groups and the inadequate resource elasticity between workloads of different business priorities. Isolation across different business groups (and their compute infrastructure management) leads to inefficient compute resource utilization and prevents us from serving the business growth needs in the long run.To meet these challenges, we propose a resource management and scheduling system named Gödel, which provides a unified compute infrastructure for all business groups to run their diverse workloads under a unified resource pool. It co-locates various workloads on every machine to achieve better resource utilization and elasticity. Gödel is built upon Kubernetes, the de facto open-source container orchestration system, but with significant components replaced or enhanced to accommodate various workloads at a large scale. In production, it manages clusters with tens of thousands of machines, achieves high overall resource utilization of over 60%, and scheduling throughput of up to 5000 pods per second. This paper reports on our design and implementation with Gödel. Moreover, it discusses the lessons and best practices we learned in developing and operating it in production at ByteDance's scale.","Cluster, Schedule, Resource Management","","","","","SoCC '23","","","","","",""

Although only a few related works have been proposed in the literature, the significance of this problem motivates the need for efficient algorithms and the exploration of new properties. One interesting property established is the symmetry of the problem, where scheduling from the first stage to the last or vice versa yields the same optimal solution. This property enhances solution quality. Considering the problem’s theoretical complexity as strongly NP-Hard, approximate solutions are preferable, especially for medium and large-scale instances. To address this, a new two-phase heuristic is proposed, consisting of a constructive phase and an improvement phase. This heuristic builds upon an existing efficient heuristic for the parallel machine-scheduling problem and extends it to incorporate unloading times efficiently. The selection of the two-phase heuristic is justified by its ability to generate high-quality schedules at each stage. Moreover, new efficient lower bounds based on estimating minimum idle time in each stage are presented, utilizing the polynomial parallel machine-scheduling problem with flow time minimization in the previous stage. These lower bounds contribute to assessing the performance of the two-phase heuristic over the relative gap performance measure. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark test problems, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The results indicate an average computation time of 9.92 s and a mean relative gap of only 2.80% for several jobs up to 200 and several stages up to 10.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Constructing its mathematical model based on the classification of these sub-problems can help better understand the problem's characteristics. However, the existing literature fails to establish MILP models of HFGSP based on the interrelation between each subproblem and the respective process constraints satisfied by each subproblem. To address this gap, our study first categorizes all the constraints in the HFGSP according to several factors: group arrangement, job arrangement within the group, process requirements between groups, process requirements between jobs from the same group, process requirements between adjacent stages, and the relationship between the decision variables of completion time and the objective constraint. Following this classification, we construct 48 available MILP models of HFGSP. Additionally, we also propose an efficient constraint programming (CP) model of HFGSP. Numerous experiments are conducted to verify the correctness and performance of all 48 MILP models across different test instances, analyze the complexities of all models, and excavate their intrinsic characteristics. Through our evaluation for the 48 models, we observe that models 24 and 48 exhibit superior performance. This highlights the effectiveness of the hybrid modeling approach, which synergistically combines sequence-based modeling for groups and position-based adjacent modeling for jobs within each group. The utilization of this hybrid modeling approach enables the construction of high-quality MILP models for addressing the HFGSP problem. Our intention is to bridge the gap between MILP modeling of HFGSP and problem-specific algorithms, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the problem and offering potential solutions.","Hybrid flow shop group scheduling; Mixed integer linear programming; Constraint programming; Heuristic algorithm; Makespan","","","","","","","","","","",""

Manufacturers face the challenge to react to dynamic energy prices and design energy cost efficient schedules in their production planning. In the literature, the energy cost-aware Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem addresses minimization of both makespan and energy costs. Recent studies provide multi-objective approaches to model the trade-off of minimizing makespan and energy costs. However, the literature is limited to coarse-grained time periods and does not consider dynamic tariffs where costs change at short intervals, so that production schedules may fall short on energy costs. We aim to close this research gap by considering frequently changing real-time energy tariffs. We propose a multi-objective memetic algorithm based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) with both makespan and energy cost minimization as the objectives. We evaluate our approach by conducting computational experiments using prominent FJSP-benchmark instances from the literature, which we supplement with empiric dynamic energy prices. We show results on method performance and compare the memetic NSGA-II with the results of an exact state-of-the-art solver. To investigate the trade-off between a short makespan and low energy costs, we present solutions on the approximated Pareto front and discuss our results.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The continuous growth of the globalizing economy has led to the prevalence of distributed manufacturing systems. Distributed flow-shop scheduling problem (DFSP) is a complex NP-hard problem that involves two highly coupled sub-problems: job allocating for factories and job sequencing within factories. This paper proposes an efficient Q-learning-based multi-objective particle swarm optimization (QL-MoPSO) to address the DFSP, with the objectives of minimizing makespan and total energy consumption. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has been enhanced by dividing particles into three subgroups, enabling faster convergence to three distinct areas of the Pareto Front (PF). Q-learning guides variable neighborhood search (VNS) as a local search strategy, balancing exploration and exploitation capabilities. To make the algorithm more reasonable and efficient for solving DFSP, multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MoPSO) uses the exchange sequence to update the job sequence vector, crossover and mutation to update the factory assignment vector. Computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm accelerates convergence and ensures good distribution performance and diversity, outperforming traditional multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both operating rooms and places in the recovery room are assumed to be multifunctional, and the objectives are to maximise the utilisation of the operating rooms, to minimise the overtime cost in the operating theatre, and to minimise the unexpected idle time between surgical cases. This weekly operating theatre planning and scheduling problem is solved in two phases. First, the planning problem is solved to give the date of surgery for each patient, allowing for the availability of operating rooms and surgeons. Then a daily scheduling problem is devised to determine the sequence of operations in each operating room in each day, taking into account the availability of recovery beds. The planning problem is described as a set-partitioning integer-programming model and is solved by a column-generation-based heuristic (CGBH) procedure. The daily scheduling problem, based on the results obtained in the planning phase, is treated as a two-stage hybrid flow-shop problem and solved by a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA). Our results are compared with several actual surgery schedules in a Belgian university hospital, where time blocks have been assigned to either specific surgeons or specialities several months in advance. According to the comparison results, surgery schedules obtained by the proposed method have less idle time between surgical cases, much higher utilisation of operating rooms and produce less overtime.","Operating theatre planning and scheduling problem; Open scheduling; Column generation; Heuristic procedure; Hybrid genetic algorithm","","","","","","","","","","",""

To solve the multiobjective FJSP problem, the production of flexible job shop can run normally and quickly. This research takes into account various characteristics of FJSP problems, such as the need to ensure the continuity and stability of processing, the existence of multiple objectives in the whole process, and the constant complexity of changes. It starts with deep learning neural networks and genetic algorithms. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) are combined in deep learning neural networks. The new improved algorithm is based on the combination of deep learning neural networks LSTM and CNN with genetic algorithm (GA), namely, CNN-LSTM-GA algorithm. Simulation results showed that the accuracy of the CNN-LSTM-GA algorithm was between 85.2% and 95.3% in the test set. In the verification set, the minimum accuracy of the CNN-LSTM-GA algorithm was 84.6%, both of which were higher than the maximum accuracy of the other two algorithms. In the FJSP simulation experiment, the AUC value of the CNN-LSTM-GA algorithm was 0.92. After 40 iterations, the F1 value of the CNN-LSTM-GA algorithm remained above 0.8, which was significantly higher than the other two algorithms. CNN-LSTM-GA is superior to the other two algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy and overall performance of FJSP. It is more suitable for solving the discrete manufacturing job scheduling problem with FJSP characteristics. This study significantly raises the utilisation rate of the assembly shop’s equipment, optimises the scheduling of FJSP, and fully utilises each processing device’s versatile characteristics, which are quite useful for the production processes of domestic vehicle manufacturing companies.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically learn PDRs based on Graph Node Embedding (GNE) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We describe JSSP as a disjunctive graph and utilize a GNE approach to facilitate better state embeddings. Ablation studies demonstrate the significant positive contribution of GNE both on JSSP and JSSP-MT. Experiments show that some high-quality combined PDRs can be learned with better approximate solutions against the traditional single PDRs.

In particular, time deviation from projected objectives is one of the main sources of economic losses in manufacturing, not only for the delay in production but also for the energy consumed by the equipment during the additional unexpected time they have to work to complete their labour. In this work we deal with uncertainty in the flexible job shop, one of the foremost scheduling problems due to its practical applications. We show the importance of a good model to avoid introducing unwanted imprecision and producing artificially pessimistic solutions. In our model, the total energy is decomposed into the energy required by resources when they are actively processing an operation and the energy consumed by these resources simply for being switched on. We propose a set of metrics and carry out an extensive experimental analysis that compares our proposal with the more straightforward alternative that directly translates the deterministic model. We also define a local search neighbourhood and prove that it can reach an optimal solution starting from any other solution. Results show the superiority of the new model and the good performance of the new neighbourhood.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the help of incentive-based programmes, grid operators can incentivise consumers to adjust power demand in critical situations such that grid stability is not threatened. On the consumer side, energy-efficient scheduling models can be used to make energy consumption more flexible. This paper proposes a bi-objective job-shop scheduling problem with variable machine speeds that aims on minimising the total energy consumption and total weighted tardiness simultaneously. We use a genetic algorithm to solve the model and derive Pareto frontiers to analyse the trade-off between both conflicting objectives. We gain insights into how incentive-based programmes can be integrated into machine scheduling models and analyse the potential interdependencies and benefits that result from this integration.","","doi: 10.1080/00207543.2023.2266765","","","","","","","","","",""

First, this paper combines medical equipment information to establish a medical equipment scheduling decision model that considers pollution to filter qualified medical equipment for scheduling. Then, this paper constructs and solves a multi-objective robust optimization model by collecting the patient's travel information and the medical pressure information of each region.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can lead to hospitalisation, particularly in elderly, immunocompromised, and non-vaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals. Although vaccination provides protection, the duration of this protection wanes over time. Additional doses can restore immunity, but the influence of viral variants, specific sequences, and vaccine-induced immune responses on disease severity remains unclear. Moreover, the efficacy of therapeutic interventions during hospitalisation requires further investigation. The study aims to analyse the clinical course of COVID-19 in hospitalised patients, taking into account SARS-CoV-2 variants, viral sequences, and the impact of different vaccines. The primary outcome is all-cause in-hospital mortality, while secondary outcomes include admission to intensive care unit and length of stay, duration of hospitalisation, and the level of respiratory support required.Methods. This ongoing multicentre study observes hospitalised adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, utilising a combination of retrospective and prospective data collection. It aims to gather clinical and laboratory variables from around 35,000 patients, with potential for a larger sample size. Data analysis will involve biostatistical and machine-learning techniques. Selected patients will provide biological material. The study started on October 14, 2021 and is scheduled to end on October 13, 2026.Discussion. The analysis of a large sample of retrospective and prospective data about the acute phase of SARS CoV-2 infection in hospitalised patients, viral variants and vaccination in several European and non-European countries will help us to better understand risk factors for disease severity and the interplay between SARS CoV-2 variants, immune responses and vaccine efficacy. The main strengths of this study are the large sample size, the long study duration covering different waves of COVID-19 and the collection of biological samples that allows future research.Registration . The trial has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. The unique identifier assigned to this trial is NCT05463380.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Home health care (HHC) is regarded as an alternative answer to hospitalization, while it plays an important role in reducing healthcare cost and improving service satisfaction. This work addresses a service resource routing and scheduling problem with sharing strategy among multiple HHC centers for given customers. Two objective functions are involved: minimizing the total operation cost including the fixed usage cost of centers, caregiver usage cost and service cost, and minimizing the total tardiness caused by delay service. Firstly, a mixed integer programming model is formulated to describe the concerned problem. Secondly, a multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm with problem-specific knowledge (MABC-PK) is proposed. Three problem-specific knowledge-based heuristics are designed to initialize population. A crossover operation and a self-learning neighborhood selection method are developed to prompt collaborative search of population and external archive. Furthermore, two knowledge-based local search methods are proposed for refining solutions in the external archive via employing some observations and priority properties derived from the problem characteristics. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted by comparing the proposed approach with four widely-acknowledged multi-objective optimization methods and a mathematical programming solver CPLEX. The comparative results and statistical analysis confirm the strong competitiveness of MABC-PK for solving the concerned problem.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some notable approaches include Tabu search, Genetic algorithms, Dynamic programming, among others. One technique of particular interest to us is Constraint Programming, which is commonly used to model and solve optimizations problems. Recently, a new variable called the sequence variable has been introduced, primarily for modeling routing problems such as the Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP) and the Patient Transportation Problem (PTP). The objective of this master's thesis is to investigate the potential of using the sequence variable to efficiently model scheduling problems and find optimal solutions. To this end, we will explore whether this variable can improve the modeling capabilities and performance of Constraint Programming in solving the Job-Shop problem.","Constraint Programming , Job-Shop , Sequence Variable , LNS , DFS","","","Anglais","Ph.D. Thesis","","","","","","UCL - Ecole polytechnique de Louvain",""

The stochastic nature is modeled by considering uncertain times between failures (TBF) and uncertain times to repair (TTR). To tackle this problem, a simheuristic approach is proposed, which combines a tabu search (TS) algorithm with Monte Carlo simulation. A total of 320 instances were used to conduct multiple experiments. Instances were generated with two distributions to study the behavior of stochastic TTR and TBF under log-normal and exponential distributions. Firstly, the performance of the simheuristic was evaluated for small instances by comparing it with the simulation of optimal solutions obtained with a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. The simheuristic approach demonstrated an average improvement of around 7% compared to the simulation of MILP model solutions. Secondly, the simheuristic performance was evaluated for medium and large-size instances by comparing it with the simulation of the solutions obtained by the earliest due date (EDD) and process time plus work in the next queue plus negative slack (PT + WINQ + SL) dispatching rules. The results showed an average improvement of around 11% compared to EDD and 14% compared to PT + WINQ + SL. Furthermore, the results highlight that even when the two distributions have the same expected value and coefficient of variation, they can yield different expected maximum lateness values. This emphasizes the importance of precise distribution fitting when solving real cases to achieve effective scheduling performance.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rescue capacity of hospitals has faced an unprecedented challenge by increasing surgical loads due to the disaster occurrence. Hospital became excessively burdened by the influx of patients, who occupy inpatient beds and operation rooms (ORs), making the availability of medical resources uncertain and scarce. This paper focuses on the post-disaster surgical scheduling problem, considering uncertain demands such as the unknown surgical operation durations or random arrivals of emergency/urgent patients, as well as the interests of multiple stakeholders (patients and hospital managers). The objective of fuzzy post-disaster surgical scheduling (FPDSS) is to simultaneously minimize the expected recovery completion time for all patients (makespan), expected average makespan while prioritizing emergency/ urgent patients, as well as the expected total idle time of ORs.

The scheduling deviations caused by the impact of internal and external environment are easy to lead the rescheduling. By introducing the digital twin (DT), the scheduling deviation between actual and planned production can be captured and the deviation can be expressed quantitatively to trigger rescheduling strategies more precisely. For the real-time scheduling problem (RSP), a DT-based deviation detection method and scheduling framework are proposed. A multi-objective model for RSP and a rescheduling strategy based on deviation detection are developed. In addition, an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (INSGA-II) is proposed to solve the RSP. The algorithm combines the adaptive mutation method and the neighborhood search method.

In addition to the advances in technologies owing to Industry 4.0, manufacturers explore autonomous and smart factories. This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent system (MAS), including intelligent agents that can respond to their environment autonomously through learning capabilities, to cope with an online machine shop scheduling problem. In the proposed system, agents participate in auctions to receive jobs to process, learn how to bid for jobs correctly, and decide when to start processing a job. The objective is to minimize the mean weighted tardiness of all jobs. In contrast to the existing literature, the proposed MAS is assessed on its learning capabilities, producing novel insights concerning what is relevant for learning, when re-learning is needed, and system response to dynamic events (such as rush jobs, increase in processing time, and machine unavailability). Computational experiments also reveal the outperformance of the proposed MAS to other multi-agent systems by at least 25% and common dispatching rules in mean weighted tardiness, as well as other performance measures.","Multi-agent system; Decentralized systems; Learning algorithm; Industry 4.0; Smart manufacturing","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nonetheless, an integrated model is the missing key to managing and improving the efficiency of ORs. This paper presents a fully integrated model regarding three concepts: meditating elective patients and emergency patients together, considering ORs and downstream units, and proposing hierarchical weekly, daily, and rescheduling models. Due to the inherent randomness in emergency patient arrival, a random forest machine learning model and geographical information systems are used to obtain the emergency patient surgery duration and arrival time, respectively. According to the machine learning model in weekly and daily scheduling, initially, fixed capacity is reserved for emergency patients. When an emergency patient arrives, the surgery starts if a reserved OR is available. Otherwise, the first available OR will be dedicated to the patient due to an emergency patient's higher priority than an elective patient. In this case, it is needed to reschedule the OT schedule for the remaining patient. Moreover, the three-phase model guarantees that an emergency patient assigns to an OR within a specific time limit. To solve the models, genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization are developed and compared. In addition, a real-world case study is undertaken at a hospital. The results of comparing the proposed approach to the hospital's current scheduling show that the three-phase model had a considerable positive effect on the ORs schedule.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When the deterioration reaches a certain level, the machine may break down, which disrupts production and requires costly Corrective Maintenance (CM) to restore operation. Preventive Maintenance (PM) can improve machine health but requires production downtime and expenses. Thus, to balance the increased production cost from degradation against the maintenance cost, it is important to jointly optimize production and maintenance scheduling. This paper aims to address the joint optimization problem for a multi-machine system to achieve the optimal overall business reward under incomplete information and system production demand constraints. We propose a novel method called Knowledge Enhanced Reinforcement Learning (KERL), which adopts a centralized multi-agent actor-critic architecture. KERL enhances the performance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for multi-machine production and maintenance scheduling by leveraging the prior knowledge of the constraint to determine the production decisions and handle the cooperation among machines in the system. The performance of KERL is evaluated in both deterministic and stochastic case studies and is compared to three baseline methods. Results show that KERL achieves a higher overall business reward than baseline methods and learns to avoid failures in the stochastic environment.","Deep reinforcement learning; Knowledge enhanced; Integrated production and maintenance optimization; Multi-machine system; Stochastic degradation; Condition-dependent cost","","","","","","","","","","",""

By utilizing vehicle trajectory and urban geographic environment data, CrowdQ can accurately estimate emergency visits from noisy traffic flows. Furthermore, it employs queueing theory to model the complex emergency service process with medical service data, effectively considering spatiotemporal dependencies and event context impact on ED queue states. Experiments conducted on large-scale crowdsensing urban traffic datasets and hospital information system datasets from Xiamen City demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. It achieves an F1 score of 0.93 in ED demand identification, effectively models the ED queue state of key hospitals, and reduces the error in queue state prediction by 18.5%-71.3% compared to baseline methods.

For DJSP, the available methods aways complete the job selection first and then search for an appropriate factory to assign the selected job, which means job selection and job assignment are done independently. This paper proposes an end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method to make the two decisions simultaneously. To capture the problem characteristics and realize the objective optimization, the Markov Decision Process (MDP) of DJSP is formulated. Specialised action space made up of operation-factory pairs is designed to achieve the simultaneous decision-making. A stitched disjunctive graph representation of DJSP is specially designed, and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based feature extraction architecture is proposed to dig the state embedding during problem solving. A Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) method is applied to train an action-selection policy. To further lead the agent to assign jobs to the factory with smaller makespan, a probability enhancement mechanism is designed. The experimental results on 240 test instances have shown that the proposed method outperforms 8 classical Priority Dispatching Rules (PDRs), 3 closely-related RL methods and 5 metaheuristics in terms of effectiveness, stability and generalization.","Distributed job shop; Scheduling; Distributed scheduling; Reinforcement learning","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the formulated VPT-FJSP process, each workpiece needs to be processed by required machine at a certain time slot where Markov decision process (MDP) and reinforcement learning methods are adopted to solve VPT-FJSP. The agent designed in this paper employs the Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO) algorithm in deep reinforcement learning, which includes the Actor-Critic network.

Whereas, the current robust programming methods proposed by Mulvey et al., Mulvey and Ruszczynski and Bai et al. (Management Science 43 (7)(1997) 895--907) require adding 2n+2m. Two logistic examples, logistic management problems involving a wine company and an airline company, demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed model.","Goal programming; Robust optimization; Stochastic programming; Logistic problem","","","","","","","","","","",""

Difficulties with such data are typically dealt with reactively-through sensitivity analysis-or proactively-through stochastic programming formulations. In this paper, we characterize the desirable properties of a solution to models, when the problem data are described by a set of scenarios for their value, instead of using point estimates. A solution to an optimization model is defined as: solution robust if it remains `close` to optimal for all scenarios of the input data, and model robust if it remains `almost` feasible for all data scenarios. We then develop a general model formulation, called robust optimization (RO), that explicitly incorporates the conflicting objectives of solution and model robustness. Robust optimization is compared with the traditional approaches of sensitivity analysis and stochastic linear programming. The classical diet problem illustrates the issues. Robust optimization models are then developed for several real-world applications: power capacity expansion; matrix balancing and image reconstruction; air-force airline scheduling; scenario immunization for financial planning; and minimum weight structural design. We also comment on the suitability of parallel and distributed computer architectures for the solution of robust optimization models.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper considers a novel OPC daily surgery scheduling problem (ODSSP) to minimise the average recovery completion time of all patients. To satisfy the OPC surgical practice, patient intake and recovery are applied in the same area for more resource flexibility, and uncertain service times for intake, surgical procedures and recovery are considered. Owing to the similarities shared between healthcare delivery systems and production systems, ODSSP is formulated as a two-stage no-wait re-entrant hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with fuzzy service times. Considering the NP-hardness of such scheduling problem, a new hybrid meta-heuristic (GA-BAVNS) is employed to obtain detailed daily OPC surgery schedules. To achieve greater balance between exploration and exploitation in the search space, GA-BAVNS hybridises a genetic algorithm (GA) and a variable neighbourhood search (VNS) to schedule outpatients for surgical services. To improve the local search performance of the VNS, six novel block-based neighbourhood structures are employed to generate neighbourhood solutions. Moreover, an adaptive neighbourhood change procedure (ANCP) is employed to systematically change the search order of neighbourhood structures for better solutions. Computational results on a set of test problems indicate the superiority of the proposed GA-BAVNS.","Scheduling; Outpatient procedure centre; Fuzzy service time; Genetic algorithm; Variable neighbourhood search","","","","","","","","","","",""

The importance of a surgery department is not only due to its direct impact on the health but also due to its high impact on the income and costs of HCs. Considering the upward trend of population aging in societies, increasing demand for surgery, and limited resources of HCs, providing an efficient schedule for Operating Room (OR) is essential. In this paper, a multi-objective mathematical model is proposed considering upstream and downstream units. The proposed model consists of three objectives in which the first one minimizes the number of deferred patients to the next planning horizon. The second one minimizes the waiting cost of scheduled patients and the cost of extra beds acquired in the ward, and the last one minimizes the idleness and overtime of ORs, lateness in operating children and earliness in operating patients far from HC. Then, the robust counterpart is proposed to evaluate some uncertain parameters, such as surgery t, Length of Stay (LoS) in upstream and downstream units and emergency demand. Since this problem is NP-hard, a new Mixed Integer Programming based Local Search Neighborhood (MIP-based LNS) algorithm is applied. Afterward, the effect of increasing number of slots on the CPU time is studied using a sensitivity analysis. Finally, a real case study entitled `Alborz Hospital'is investigated. The obtained results show that applying the proposed model and increasing two beds in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) could potentially decrease the number of deferred patients by 58.33% as compared to the traditional schedule (i.e., a schedule based on trial and error). Furthermore, the average idleness of ORs could be reduced by 36.58% as compared to the traditional schedule.","Operating room scheduling; Operational decision-making; Upstream unit; Downstream unit; Emergency demand; Robust optimization","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim is to propose a systematic approach to help the surgical planner in the scheduling of elective surgeries, in order to optimize the use of the available surgical resources, and improve equity and access to operated and waiting patients. The decisions to be taken by this surgical case assignment problem are twofold: select patients to be scheduled in the planning horizon from a large waiting list for surgery; and assign a day, an operating room, and a time block to the selected patients. Three versions are modeled in (mixed) integer linear programming: from the administration's intention up to the surgeons'current practice, and a halfway reflecting a negotiation with the surgeons. A robust approach is proposed to tackle the uncertain surgeries'duration without the need to assume a given distribution for these random parameters and allowing to control the level of conservatism in the solutions. Practical and real-sized problems from the hospital are solved providing very good optimization gaps within a short time limit, both for the deterministic and robust approaches.

This paper proposes a two-stage chance-constrained model to solve the OR scheduling problem under uncertainty. The goal is to minimize the costs associated with OR opening and overtime as well as reduce patient waiting times. The risk of OR overtime is controlled using chance constraints. Numerical experiments show that the proposed model provides a better trade-off between minimizing costs and reducing solution variability when compared to two existing models in the literature. It is also shown that the three models converge as the overtime probability threshold approaches one. Moreover, it is observed that the individual chance constraints result in the opening of fewer rooms, lower waiting times, and shorter solution times when compared to that of joint chance constraints. A decomposition algorithm is applied that solves large test instances of the OR scheduling problem, that of which is known to be NP-hard. Strong valid inequalities are derived in order to accelerate the convergence speed.

We consider the use of a weekly surgery schedule with an open scheduling strategy that takes into account the availabilities of surgeons and operating rooms. The objective is to minimize the total operating cost while maximizing the utilization of the operating rooms but also minimizing overtime use. A revised mathematical model is proposed that can provide optimal solutions for a surgery size up to 110 surgical cases. Next, two modified heuristics, based on the earliest due date (EDD) and longest processing time (LPT) rules, are proposed to quickly find feasible solutions to the studied problem. Finally, an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm that incorporates the initial solutions, a recovery scheme, local search schemes, and an elitism strategy is proposed. The computational results show that, for a surgery size between 40 and 100 surgical cases, the ABC algorithm found optimal solutions to all of the tested problems. For surgery sizes larger than 110 surgical cases, the ABC algorithm performed significantly better than the two proposed heuristics.

The approach developed searches for a feasible and robust solution designed to balance the trade-off arising between the hospital and patient perspectives, i.e. maximizing the OR utilization and minimizing the number of patient cancellations. The contribution of this paper is twofold. The former, more methodological, is to provide an efficient algorithmic framework to solve the joint advance and allocation scheduling problem taking into account the inherent uncertainty of surgery durations. The latter, more practical, is to provide a tool to develop robust offline OR schedules which consider the trade-off between reducing surgery cancellations and postponements while maximizing the operating theater utilization. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithmic approach, in terms of quality of solutions and solution time, we provide a computational analysis on a set of instances based on real data.","Operating room planning and scheduling; Uncertain surgery duration; Metaheuristic; Monte Carlo simulation","","","","","","","","","","",""

To solve the problem we propose a Monte Carlo optimization method based on the sample average approximation method, which combines an iterative greedy local search method and Monte Carlo simulation. The performance of the iterative greedy local search method is evaluated against an exact method and two existing heuristic methods for solving the deterministic version of the problem, using testbeds generated based on the literature. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to evaluate the performance of the Monte Carlo optimization method in a stochastic setting. The results show that the objective function value converges with exponential rates when the number of samples increases, obtaining an optimality index value around 1 %. By comparing the results against the solution obtained by the corresponding deterministic expected value problem, we conclude that an important cost reduction can be obtained by solving the stochastic problem rather than the deterministic one.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assume a block scheduling strategy in which the number and the length of available blocks are given. As each block is related to a specific day, by assigning a patient to a block his/her surgery date is fixed, as well. Each patient is characterized by a recommended maximum waiting time and an uncertain surgery duration. In practical applications, new patients enter the waiting list continuously. Patient selection and assignment is performed by surgery departments on a short-term, usually a week, regular base. We propose a so-called rolling horizon approach for the patient selection and assignment. At each iteration short-term patient assignment is decided. However, in a look-ahead perspective, a longer planning horizon is considered when looking for the patient selection. The mid-term assignment over the next $$n$$weeks is generated by solving an ILP problem, minimizing a penalty function based on total waiting time and tardiness of patients. The approach is iteratively applied by shifting ahead the mid-term planning horizon. When applying the first week solution, unpredictable extensions of surgeries may disrupt the schedule. Such disruptions are recovered in the next iteration: the mid-term solution is rescheduled limiting the number of variations from the previously computed plan. Besides, the approach allows to deal with new patient arrivals. To keep limited the number of disruptions due to uncertain surgery duration, we propose also a robust formulation of the ILP problem. The deterministic and the robust formulation based frameworks are compared over a set of instances, including different stochastic realization of surgery times.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A major difficulty stems from the fact that such an allocation must be established several months in advance, and the exact number of patients for each specialty is an uncertain parameter. Another problem arises for cyclic schedules, where the allocation is defined over a short period, e.g. a week, and then repeated during the time horizon. However, the demand typically varies from week to week: even if we know in advance the exact demand for each week, the weekly schedule cannot be adapted accordingly. We model both the uncertain and the cyclic allocation problem as adjustable robust scheduling problems.

In many medium- and small-scale hospitals, no OR capacity is affiliated with a particular subspecialty, but several subspecialties share the OR capacity in the hospital. The administrator needs to decide how much OR capacity to assign to each subspecialty and how much to reserve for emergency surgeries. Because such an allocation is usually decided several weeks or even months before, the only information about future demands is their range. We focus on finding a robust solution that handles disturbances in the surgery demand. An adjustable robust model is developed to solve this surgery capacity allocation problem with demand uncertainty. The worst-case revenue loss resulting from a shortage of OR resources is minimised. We examine the impact of conservativeness of the robust model on the revenue loss of the surgery department, which provides hospital administrators guidance for setting the adjustable parameters. An implementer-adversary algorithm is applied to solve the robust optimisation model. We present computational results comparing the proposed robust optimisation approach with a scenario-based stochastic optimisation; the results show that by adjusting the conservatism, the expected objective value realised by the robust solution is very close to that obtained by the stochastic programming approach. Moreover, the robust optimisation method has the benefit of limiting the worst-case outcome of the surgery capacity allocation problem.","","doi: 10.1080/00207543.2015.1056318","","","","","","","","","",""

The reforms established a maximum waiting time between diagnosis and treatment for a set of diseases, described as an opportunity guarantee within the reform. If the maximum waiting time is exceeded, the patient is referred to another (private) facility and receives a voucher to cover the additional expenses. This voucher is paid by the health provider that had to do the procedure, which generally is a public hospital. In general, this reform has improved the service for patients with GES pathologies at the expense of patients with non-GES pathologies. These new conditions create a complicated planning scenario for hospitals, in which the hospital's OR Manager must balance the fulfillment of these opportunity guarantees and the timely service of patients not covered by the guarantee. With the collaboration of the Instituto de Neurocirugía, in Santiago, Chile, we developed a mathematical model based on stochastic dynamic programming to schedule surgeries in order to minimize the cost of referrals to the private sector. Given the large size of the state space, we developed an heuristic to compute good solutions in reasonable time and analyzed its performance. Our experimental results, with both simulated and real data, show that our algorithm performs close to optimum and improves upon the current practice. When we compared the results of our heuristic against those obtained by the hospital's OR manager in a simulation setting with real data, we reduced the overtime from occurring 21% of the time to zero, and the non-GES average waiting list's length from 71 to 58 patients, without worsening the average throughput.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The complicated connection and interplay between ORs and their upstream and downstream units has recently attracted research attention to focus more on allocating medical resources efficiently for the sake of a balanced coordination. As a critical step, surgical scheduling in the presence of uncertain surgery durations is pivotal but rather challenging since a patient cannot be hospitalized if a recovery bed will not be available to accommodate the admission. To tackle the challenge, we propose an overflow strategy that allows patients to be assigned to an undesignated department if the designated one is full. It has been proved that overflow strategy can successfully alleviate the imbalance of capacity utilization. However, some studies indicate that implementation of the overflow strategy exacerbates the readmission rate as well as the length of stay (LOS). To rigorously examine the overflow strategy and explore its optimal solution, we propose a Fuzzy model for surgical scheduling by explicitly considering downstream shortage, as well as the uncertainty of surgery duration and patient LOS. To solve the Fuzzy model, a hybrid algorithm (so-called GA-P) is developed, stemming from Genetic Algorithm (GA). Extensive numerical results demonstrate the plausible efficiency of the GA-P algorithm, especially for large-scale scheduling problems (e.g., comprehensive hospitals). Additionally, it is shown that the overflow cost plays a critical role in determining the efficiency of the overflow strategy; viz., benefits from the overflow strategy can be reduced as the overflow cost increases, and eventually almost vanishes when the cost becomes sufficiently large. Finally, the Fuzzy model is tested to be effective in terms of simplicity and reliability, yet without cannibalizing the patient admission rate.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the inherent uncertainty in surgery duration and its consecutive PACU time, the completion time of a patient should be modeled as the sum of a number of random variables. Some researchers have proposed the use of the normal distribution for its well-known additive property, but there are questions regarding its fitting adequacy to real OTR data, which tends to be asymmetric with a long tail. We propose to estimate the surgery and PACU times with the family of Continuous PHase-type (CPH) distributions, which provides both fitting adequacy and additive property. We first compute the completion time of each patient analytically and compare the results with normal and lognormal distributions on a series of real OTR datasets. Then, we develop a search algorithm embedding a constructive heuristic and a meta-heuristic algorithm as a sequence generator engine for the patients, and apply the CPH distribution as a chance constraint to eventually find the schedule of each sequence in the OTR problem. The best algorithm among several tested constructive heuristic algorithms is used as the neighborhood structure of meta-heuristic algorithms. We finally construct a numerical example of OTR problem to illustrate the application of the proposed algorithm.","","doi: 10.1080/24725854.2019.1628372","","","","","","","","","",""

A number of different variants of the Patient Admission Scheduling Problem exist at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels.

Both elective and emergency operations are included, such that the elective operations are planned while still taking potential emergency operations into consideration. Furthermore, the duration of each operation is uncertain. The aim is to construct robust operating room schedules that minimise overtime work and release unused capacity. Due to the uncertainty associated with arrival of emergency patients and also the duration of each operation, a deterministic model is not suitable for this problem. Therefore, we develop a stochastic model where operation duration can vary and where the arrivals of emergency patients are unknown. The stochastic model is computationally heavy, so two mixed integer programming based heuristics denoted 2-Step Relax-and-Fix and All Open Relax-and-Fix are developed to solve the problem. The computational study is based on an extensive dataset compromising 304 days. The heuristics give good results with half of the operating rooms having less than 8 min of overtime work. To test the robustness of the solutions we carry out a simulated implementation of the operation plans. The simulation shows that the heuristic solutions are fairly robust.

Three versions of the problem are considered and local search heuristics are developed in order to quickly find good solutions for each version of the problem. The heuristics select patients from a long waiting list for surgery to be scheduled in each week, and define a room, a day and a shift for each selected surgery according to one of three different perspectives of the problem. The heuristics developed are tested in real instances and the values of the solutions are compared with the values of the solutions obtained using mixed integer linear programming models. The solutions obtained by the heuristics are of very good quality and the computational time required is generally quite low, even considering the instances with more surgeries in the waiting list.

We assume a block scheduling strategy in which the number and the length of available blocks are given. As each block is related to a specific day, by assigning a patient to a block his/her surgery date is fixed, as well. Each patient is characterized by a recommended maximum waiting time and an uncertain surgery duration. In practical applications, new patients enter the waiting list continuously. Patient selection and assignment is performed by surgery departments on a short-term, usually a week, regular base. We propose a so-called rolling horizon approach for the patient selection and assignment. At each iteration short-term patient assignment is decided. However, in a look-ahead perspective, a longer planning horizon is considered when looking for the patient selection. The mid-term assignment over the next $$n$$weeks is generated by solving an ILP problem, minimizing a penalty function based on total waiting time and tardiness of patients. The approach is iteratively applied by shifting ahead the mid-term planning horizon. When applying the first week solution, unpredictable extensions of surgeries may disrupt the schedule. Such disruptions are recovered in the next iteration: the mid-term solution is rescheduled limiting the number of variations from the previously computed plan. Besides, the approach allows to deal with new patient arrivals. To keep limited the number of disruptions due to uncertain surgery duration, we propose also a robust formulation of the ILP problem. The deterministic and the robust formulation based frameworks are compared over a set of instances, including different stochastic realization of surgery times.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this paper is to extend and generalize existing approaches for the joint OR planning and scheduling problem. First, by allowing schedules that include patients requiring weekend stay beds which was not the case previously. Second, by tackling simultaneously both the OR planning and patient scheduling decision levels, instead of taking them into account in successive phases. To achieve this, we exploit the inherent hierarchy between the two decision levels, i.e.,the fact that the assignment decisions of OR time blocks to surgical specialties directly affect those regarding the scheduling of patients, but not the reverse. The objective function used in this study is an extension of an existing one. It seeks to optimize both patient utility (by reducing waiting time costs) and hospital utility (by reducing production costs measured in terms of the number of weekend stay beds required by the surgery planning). 0--1 linear programming formulations exploiting the stated hierarchy are proposed and used to derive a formal proof that the problem is NP-hard. A two level metaheuristic is then developed for solving the problem and its effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments carried out on a large set of instances based on real data.","Operating room planning; Advanced scheduling; 0--1 model; Metaheuristic","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to solve realistic-sized instances in a reasonable amount of time, we develop tailored heuristic solution strategies that exploit the problem structure. Computational results obtained on a set of randomly generated problems show the effective impact of the stochastic programming approach and the efficiency of the proposed heuristics.","","","","","","","","https://academic.oup.com/imaman/article-pdf/26/1/99/2429536/dpt027.pdf","","","",""

In this study, we present a novel two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model to minimize total expected operating cost given that scheduling decisions are made before the resolution of uncertainty in surgery durations. We use this model to quantify the benefit of pooling ORs as a shared resource and to illustrate the impact of parallel surgery processing on surgery schedules. Decisions in our model include the number of ORs to open each day, the allocation of surgeries to ORs, the sequence of surgeries within each OR, and the start time for each surgeon. Realistic-sized instances of our model are difficult or impossible to solve with standard stochastic programming techniques. Therefore, we exploit several structural properties of the model to achieve computational advantages. Furthermore, we describe a novel set of widely applicable valid inequalities that make it possible to solve practical instances. Based on our results for different resource usage schemes, we conclude that the impact of parallel surgery processing and the benefit of OR pooling are significant. The latter may lead to total cost reductions between 21% and 59% on average.","","doi: 10.1287/ijoc.1100.0396","","","","","","","","","",""

By virtue of its huge consumption of human and material resources, the operating theatre is one of the most important sources of expenses of the hospitals. A less costly organization of the operating rooms calls for a more rational use of the resources and a more refined planning of the surgical units. In addition to these considerations, we are concerned about the well-being of the medical staff. We integrate this human factor into the optimization procedure by stressing the human resources'availabilities in the design of the schedules. This planning process is typically decomposed in two sequential phases: a planning stage followed by a scheduling stage. Due to this decomposition the resulting solutions may turn out to be sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose a formulation that includes both the planning and scheduling of the surgical operations.

When the capacity is available, patients with a higher priority are selected from the waiting list and put on the schedule. At the beginning of each period, a decision of the number of patients to be scheduled is made based on the trade-offs between the cost for overtime work and the cost for surgery postponement. A stochastic dynamic programming model is formulated to address this problem. A structural analysis of the proposed model is conducted to understand the properties of an optimal schedule policy. Based on the structural analysis, bounds on feasible actions are incorporated into a value iteration algorithm, and a brief computation experiment shows the improvement in computational efficiency. Numerical examples show that the consideration of patient priority results in significant differences in surgery schedules from the schedule that ignores the patient priority.","Surgery scheduling problem; Patient priority; Stochastic dynamic programming","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both operating rooms and places in the recovery room are assumed to be multifunctional, and the objectives are to maximise the utilisation of the operating rooms, to minimise the overtime cost in the operating theatre, and to minimise the unexpected idle time between surgical cases. This weekly operating theatre planning and scheduling problem is solved in two phases. First, the planning problem is solved to give the date of surgery for each patient, allowing for the availability of operating rooms and surgeons. Then a daily scheduling problem is devised to determine the sequence of operations in each operating room in each day, taking into account the availability of recovery beds. The planning problem is described as a set-partitioning integer-programming model and is solved by a column-generation-based heuristic (CGBH) procedure. The daily scheduling problem, based on the results obtained in the planning phase, is treated as a two-stage hybrid flow-shop problem and solved by a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA). Our results are compared with several actual surgery schedules in a Belgian university hospital, where time blocks have been assigned to either specific surgeons or specialities several months in advance. According to the comparison results, surgery schedules obtained by the proposed method have less idle time between surgical cases, much higher utilisation of operating rooms and produce less overtime.","Operating theatre planning and scheduling problem; Open scheduling; Column generation; Heuristic procedure; Hybrid genetic algorithm","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many researchers have highlighted issues in the optimization of surgical scheduling problems. However, most recent reviews limited the issues at the operational level and excluded the problem characteristics such as surgery group type and schedule cyclicity. This study aims to review the state-of-the-art of MSSP and identify new trends in optimization strategies (problem characteristics and objective function), uncertainty scheduling factors (types and approaches), and solution and evaluation methods. These aspects are the key components in developing an effective MSSP optimization model. This paper reviews articles published between 2000 and 2021 that addressed the MSSP, concentrating on papers between 2016 and 2021. We underlined the popularity of medical specialities as the surgery group, one-week horizon length, a cyclic schedule, multi-objective optimization and evaluation by benchmarking. The analysis shows that surgery duration is the most prominent uncertainty type, whereas strategies for handling this are stochastic programming, robust optimization, and fuzzy programming. We highlighted the role of heuristic approaches in addressing the MSSP's computational complexity. This review's trends, challenges, and potential solutions are essential for future researchers in developing optimization models for MSSP.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Medical institutions have given top priority to reforming the appointment system for many years; however, whether the increased information transparency brought about by the appointment scheduling mechanism could improve patient waiting time is not well understood. In this study, the authors examine the effects of information transparency in reducing patient waiting time from an uncertainty perspective. Design/methodology/approach Leveraging a quasi-natural experiment in a tertiary academic hospital, the authors analyze over one million observational patient visit records and design the propensity score matching plus the difference in difference (PSM-DID) model and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to address this issue. Findings The authors confirm that, on average, improved information transparency significantly reduces the waiting time for patients by approximately 6.43 min, a 4.90% reduction. The authors identify three types of uncertainties (resource, process and outcome uncertainty) in the patient visit process that affect patients' waiting time.

Three types of identical resources are considered: transporters, operating rooms and recovery beds. A fixed number of patients must be planned over a term horizon, usually one or two weeks. The surgery process is modelled as follows: each patient is transported from the ward to the operating theatre. Then the patient visits an operating room for surgery operation and is transferred to the recovery room. If no recovery bed is available, the patient wakes up in the operating room until a bed becomes available. The operating room needs to be cleaned after the patient's departure, before starting another operation. Finally, the patient is transported back to the ward after his recovery. We consider several criteria based on patients'completion times. We propose a Lagrangian relaxation-based method to solve this operating theatre scheduling problem. The efficiency of this method is then validated by numerical experiments. A comprehensive numerical experiment is then performed to quantify the benefit of allowing patient recovery in operating rooms. We show that the benefit is high when the workload of the recovery beds is high.","Operating theatre; Surgery scheduling; Lagrangian relaxation; Recovery bed","","","","","","","","","","",""

BDORS is formulated as a novel mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) in which the macro and micro imbalance are penalized using absolute value and quadratic functions. We develop various reformulation-linearization techniques (RLTs) for the MINLP models, leading to three mathematical modelling variants: (i) a mixed-integer quadratically constrained program (MIQCP) and (ii) two mixed-integer programs (MIPs) for the absolute value penalty function and an MIQCP for the quadratic penalty function. Two novel exact techniques based on reformulation-decomposition techniques (RDTs) are developed to solve these models: a uni- and a bi-level logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD). We motivate the LBBD methods with an application to BDORS in the University Health Network (UHN), consisting of three collaborating hospitals: Toronto General Hospital, Toronto Western Hospital, and Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The uni-level LBBD method decomposes the model into a surgical suite location, OR allocation, and macro balancing master problem (MP) and micro OR balancing sub-problems (SPs) for each hospital-day. The bi-level approach uses a relaxed MP, consisting of a surgical suite location and relaxed allocation/macro balancing MP and two optimization SPs. The primary SP is formulated as a bin-packing problem to allocate patients to open operating rooms to minimize the number of ORs, while the secondary SP is the uni-level micro balancing SP. Using UHN datasets consisting of two datasets, hard MP/easy SPs and easy MP/hard SPs, we show that both LBBD approaches and both MIP models solved via Gurobi converge to ≈2% and ≈1--2% optimality gaps, on average, respectively, within 30 minutes runtime, whereas the MIQCP solved via Gurobi could not solve any instance of the UHN datasets given the same runtime. The uni- and bi-level LBBD approaches solved all instances of hard MP/easy SPs dataset to ≈11% and ≈2% optimality gaps, on average, respectively, within 30 minutes runtime, whereas MIQCP solved via Gurobi could not solve any of these instances. Additionally, we show that convergence of each LBBD varies depending on where in the decomposition the actual computational complexity lies.","Healthcare; Operating room scheduling; Balanced location-allocation; Large scale optimization; Multi-level decomposition; Logic-based Benders balancing cuts; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our model is the first known approach that can jointly handle general walk-in processes and heterogeneous, time-dependent no-show behaviors. We demonstrate that, with walk-ins, the optimal schedules are fundamentally different from those without. Our numerical study reveals that walk-ins introduce a new source of uncertainties to the system and cannot be viewed as a simple solution to compensate for patient no-shows. Scheduling, however, is an effective way to counter some of the negative impact from uncertain patient behaviors. Using data from practice, we predict a significant cost reduction (42%?73% on average) if the providers were to switch from current practice (which tends to overlook walk-ins in planning) to our proposed schedules.

To improve the performance of outpatient departments, this paper attempts to make an appointment schedule by considering walk-ins and the waiting time target (WTT) for appointment patients. A stochastic programming model is proposed to solve this problem with the objective of minimizing the weighted patient waiting and makespan cost. A non-decreasing waiting cost function is used to capture the WTT fulfillment of appointment patients, whereas walk-ins incur a linear waiting cost. A finite-horizon Markov Decision Process model is formulated to establish the optimal real-time scheduling policy under a given appointment schedule. The appointment schedule is determined by a two-stage stochastic programming approximation and a local search improvement. Structural properties of the optimal appointment scheduling and real-time scheduling policies are established. In particular, it is shown that appointment overbooking is allowed only at the end of the regular session, and the optimal real-time scheduling policy is an easy-to-implement threshold policy with bounded sensitivity. Numerical experiments based on real data are performed to investigate the influence of different parameters and to compare different schedules. The optimal schedule demonstrates superior performance by allowing reasonable waiting times for appointment patients depending on their WTTs. Managerial insights are also provided to hospital managers. Finally, the basic model is extended by incorporating random service times and random arrivals of appointment patients. The latter includes the random number of patients that show up for service or call for appointments, and the random arrival time (unpunctuality). Appointment overbooking strategies are shown to have different structures under some stochastic factors.","Appointment and real-time scheduling; Walk-in patients; Waiting time target; Stochastic programming; Markov decision process","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, home healthcare (HHC) operations including a set of nurses and patients have been developed recently by both academia and health practitioners to consider elderlies'preferences willing to receive their cares at their homes instead of hospitals or retirement homes. Commonly, different services, e.g., nursing, physiotherapy, housekeeping and cleaning, for an HHC system are performed by nurses at patients'homes after scheduling and routing the nurses by decision makers. Due to the difficulty of the problem, recent studies show a great deal of interest in applying various metaheuristics and heuristics to solve this problem. To alleviate the drawbacks of previous works and make HHC more practical, this paper develops not only a new mathematical formulation considering new suppositions in this research area but also a lower bound based on Lagrangian relaxation theory has been employed. As such, three new heuristics and a hybrid constructive metaheuristic are utilized in this study to solve the proposed model.

Some researchers have proposed the use of the normal distribution for its well-known additive property, but there are questions regarding its fitting adequacy to real OTR data, which tends to be asymmetric with a long tail. We propose to estimate the surgery and PACU times with the family of Continuous PHase-type (CPH) distributions, which provides both fitting adequacy and additive property. We first compute the completion time of each patient analytically and compare the results with normal and lognormal distributions on a series of real OTR datasets. Then, we develop a search algorithm embedding a constructive heuristic and a meta-heuristic algorithm as a sequence generator engine for the patients, and apply the CPH distribution as a chance constraint to eventually find the schedule of each sequence in the OTR problem. The best algorithm among several tested constructive heuristic algorithms is used as the neighborhood structure of meta-heuristic algorithms.

The problem is motivated by our studies of independent datasets from countries in two continents that unanimously identify a significant time-of-day effect on patient show-up probabilities. We deploy a distributionally robust model, which minimizes the worst-case total expected costs of patient waiting and service provider?s idling and overtime, by optimizing the scheduled arrival times of patients. This model is challenging because evaluating the total cost for a given schedule involves a linear program with uncertainties present in both the objective function and the right-hand side of the constraints. In addition, the ambiguity set considered contains discrete uncertainties and complementary functional relationships among these uncertainties (namely, patient no-shows and service durations). We show that when patient no-shows are exogenous (i.e., time-independent), the problem can be reformulated as a copositive program and then be approximated by semidefinite programs. When patient no-shows are endogenous on time (and hence on the schedule), the problem becomes a bilinear copositive program. We construct a set of dual prices to guide the search for a good schedule and use the technique iteratively to obtain a near-optimal solution. Our computational studies reveal a significant reduction in total expected cost by taking into account the time-of-day variation in patient show-up probabilities as opposed to ignoring it.This paper was accepted by David Simchi-Levi, optimization.","","doi: 10.1287/mnsc.2019.3366","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose a single step mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach that approximates the bed and OR usage and a simulated annealing approach. Both approaches are compared on a real-life data set and results show that the MILP performs best in terms of solution quality and computation time.

We formulate VRPS with stochastic times as a two-stage stochastic integer programming model that, unlike the deterministic models in the VRPS literature, does not have any big-M constraints. This advantage comes at the cost of a large number of second-stage integer variables. We prove that the integrality constraints on second-stage variables can be relaxed, and therefore, we can apply the L-shaped algorithm and its branch-and-cut implementation to solve the problem. We enhance the model by developing valid inequalities and a lower bounding functional. We analyze the subproblems of the L-shaped algorithm and devise a specialized algorithm for them that is significantly faster than standard linear programming algorithms. Computational results show that the branch-and-cut algorithm optimally solves stochastic home healthcare scheduling instances with 15 patients and 10%?30% of synchronized visits.

In this paper, we integrate the surgical case planning and scheduling problem and include the nurse re-rostering decision and nurse assignment to specific patients in order to utilise the operating room department as efficiently as possible and maximise the operating room profit. We propose a two-phase heuristic that uses the LP solution generated via column generation to construct a high-quality feasible solution.

For this purpose, a multi-objective mathematical programming model is proposed for the construction of master surgical scheduling and the allocation of elective and emergency surgeries. This model encompasses the profits of all stakeholders in the operating theater. A new policy, named complete opening policy, is introduced for the management of operating rooms that has some particular benefits compared to the conventional policy. Then, a scenario-based robust formulation is proposed to consider the uncertainties of surgery duration, length of stay and emergency demands. Because the simpler variants of this problem are known to be NP-complete, a new two-stage heuristic algorithm is developed for solving its large-scale instances. During the first stage, this algorithm generates an initial solution using a greedy constructive algorithm. To improve the initial solution, the algorithm applies eight actions and searches the neighborhoods. In the second stage, the algorithm evaluates whether or not closing an operating room could improve the incumbent solution. A heuristic algorithm, named partial-mixed integer programming, is also adapted as a benchmark algorithm. This algorithm incorporates the CPLEX solver and a very large-scale neighborhood search. Eventually, a hospital in Iran is introduced and evaluated. The computational results demonstrate that the application of the proposed methodology could potentially decrease the waiting cost, the overtime and idleness of operating rooms, and the total deviation from the average beds used in upstream and downstream. The computational results also show that an increase of two beds in the intensive care unit might potentially reduce the waiting cost by 3.6% and the total average of overtime and idleness of operating rooms each day by 20.3%.","Operating room; Tactical decision-making; Operational decision-making; Uncertainty; Heuristic algorithm","","","","","","","","","","",""

We operated about 100,609 cases in the OR during the study period. Daytime utilization rate increased from 85.6% to 89.4% (P < 0.001); overall OR utilization rate from 115.1% to 117.6% (P = 0.019); daily case numbers from 229.9 $\pm$7.3 to 239.6 $\pm$7.6 (P = 0.0.14); and cumulative operation time of total and daytime cases from 611.7 case-hour/day to 624.5 case-hour/day (P = 0.013) and from 510.8 case-hour/day to 533.8 case-hour/day (P < 0.001), respectively.

To solve the MSSP, we propose a simulation-optimization approach consisting of a two-stage stochastic optimization model and a discrete-event simulation model. For the two-stage stochastic optimization model, uncertain arrivals of emergency patients are represented by discrete scenarios. The discrete-event simulation model is developed to address uncertainty related to the surgery duration and the length of stay at the hospital, and to test the Master Surgery Schedule (MSS) developed by the optimization model in a stochastic operational-level environment. In addition, the simulation model is used to generate scenarios for the optimization model. We present some general advice for surgery scheduling based on testing the optimization model in a numerical study. The simulation-optimization approach is applied to a case study from a hospital department that treats both elective and emergency patients.

Operating room (OR) scheduling is one of the issues that has gained our attention because it is related to workflow efficiency and critical care of hospitals. Automatic scheduling and high predictive accuracy of surgical case duration have a critical role in improving OR utilization. To estimate surgical case duration, most hospitals might rely on historical averages based on a specific surgeon or a specific procedure type obtained from electronic medical record (EMR) scheduling systems. However, the low predictive accuracy with EMR data leads to negative impacts on patients and hospitals, such as rescheduling of surgeries and cancellation. This study aims to improve and interpret the prediction of surgical case duration with machine learning (ML) methodology. A large data set containing 170,748 surgical cases (from Jan 2017 to Dec 2019) was obtained from a hospital, and it covered a broad variety of details on patients, surgeries, specialties and surgical teams. In addition, a more recent data set with 8,672 cases (from Mar to Apr 2020) was available to be used for time-wise evaluation. Historical averages were computed from the EMR data for surgeon- or procedure-specific cases, and served as baseline models for comparison. Subsequently, models were built with linear regression, random forest and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) algorithms, and were evaluated with R-square (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), percentage overage (actual duration longer than prediction), underage (shorter than prediction) and within (absolute duration differences falling within minimum(maximum(15 %,15 min), 60 min) of prediction). The XGB model was superior to the other models, achieving a higher R2 (84 %) as well as a lower MAE (31.1 min) and inaccurate percentage (24.4 %). In addition, XGB predictions were analyzed with Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). SHAP interpretation on complex cases (e.g. containing more than 2 procedures) unraveled that older primary surgeons took shorter time to complete the surgery and primary surgeons with longer previous surgical time within a week took more time to complete the surgery. Longer durations were utilized when patient\textquoterights hypertension status was unknown. Meanwhile, SHAP interpretation on model loss showed that the loss values of elder primary surgeons increased for cases with larger deviations in prediction suggesting additional information related to surgeon is required for model improvement. Overall, this study applied ML techniques in the field of OR scheduling to reduce the medical and financial burden for healthcare management. The results revealed the impact of main factors (e.g. anesthesia, procedure types, no. of procedure) and interaction effects (e.g. no. of procedure x primary surgeon\textquoterights age) in surgical case duration prediction as well as identified the feature that contributes to errors in prediction.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo external funding received.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:We have obtained an institutional review board approval (CMUH109-REC1-091) from China Medical University Hospital.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

The method differs significantly from an exact column generation approach or a branch and price algorithm because it performs an incomplete search which quickly produces good solutions but does not provide valid lower bounds. It is effective on large instances for which it has produced best known solutions on benchmark data instances. Several innovations were required to produce solutions for the largest instances within acceptable computation times. These include using a fast first-order linear programming solver based on the work of Chambolle and Pock to approximately solve the restricted master problem. A low-accuracy but fast, first-order linear programming method is shown to be an effective option for this master problem. The pricing problem is modelled as a resource constrained shortest path problem with a two-phase dynamic programming method. The model requires only two resources. This enables it to be solved efficiently. A commercial integer programming solver is also tested on the instances. The commercial solver was unable to produce solutions on the largest instances whereas the heuristic method was able to. It is also compared against the state-of-the-art, previously published methods on these instances. Analysis of the branching strategy developed is presented to provide further insights.

Managing operating rooms is challenging due to conflicting priorities and preferences of various stakeholders and the inherent uncertainty of surgery durations. In this study, we consider the next-day scheduling problem of a hospital operating room. Given the list and the sequence of non-identical surgeries to be performed in the next day, one needs to determine the scheduled durations of surgeries where the actual duration of each surgery is uncertain. Our objective is to minimize the weighted sum of expected patient waiting times, room idle time and overtime. First, we provide a reformulation of the objective function in terms of auxiliary functions with a recursive pattern that enables exact analysis of the optimal surgery durations at the expense of high CPU time. Next, we develop and analyze simple-to-use and close-to-optimal scheduling heuristics motivated by practice, for the OR managers to deploy in the field. Our proposed hybrid heuristic attains 1.22% average performance gap and worst average optimality gap of 2.77%. Our solution is easy to implement as it does not require any advanced optimization tool, which is the reality of many operating room environments.","OR in health services; Operating room planning; Scheduling; Stochastic optimization; Heuristics","","","","","","","","","","",""

To alleviate the negative impact of unpunctual patients, this study addresses the appointment scheduling (AS) in the simultaneous presence of unpunctual patients, multiple servers, and no-shows. To determine the appointment schedule, we propose a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model to minimise the total cost incurred by patient waiting and clinic overtime. It becomes challenging for a standard solver to solve this model due to the dynamic patient-to-server assignment decisions that are proactively anticipated in the determination of appointment times. To deal with this problem, a stochastic approximation algorithm is proposed under unbiased gradient estimators. The effectiveness and efficiency of this algorithm are validated in extensive numerical experiments that compare it with Benders decomposition and a heuristic algorithm. Further, the features of the optimal appointment schedule are analysed: (i) the shape of the appointment intervals relies on the number of servers; (ii) the length of intervals is sensitive to no-shows; (iii) the initial block size is greatly affected by patient unpunctuality. Managerial insights are also provided for hospital managers to schedule unpunctual patients in practice.","","doi: 10.1080/00207543.2020.1744766","","","","","","","","","",""

A challenge to optimize the OR efficiency is to improve the surgery scheduling task, which requires the estimation of surgical time duration. Surgeons or programming units (based on people's experience) typically do the duration estimation using an experience-based strategy, which may include some bias, such as overestimating the surgery time, increasing ORs' operational cost. Methods This paper analyzes a machine learning-based solution for surgical time predictions. We apply and compare four machine-learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, Regression Trees, and Bagged Trees) to predict the surgical time duration at a tertiary referral university hospital in Bogotá, Colombia. Historical data from 2004 until 2019 was used to train the algorithms. Comparison among algorithms was given in terms of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the predicted surgery duration and the algorithms' computing time. The algorithm with the best performance was compared to the currently used experience-based method. Results All the ML algorithms predict the surgery duration with an error between 26 and 37 min. The best overall performance was obtained using Bagged Trees (26 min RMSE, 3.16 min training time, 0.49 min testing time) when using a subset of the DB with the nine specialties containing 80% of the surgeries. Bagged Trees also outperformed the experience-based method with a lower RMSE; however, it also shifted from a predominant overestimation to underestimating surgeries' duration. Conclusions Different ML algorithms for predicting the surgical time duration, showing and comparing their performance. Bagged Trees showed the best performance in terms of RMSE and computing time. Depending on the initial data, Bagged Trees outperformed the experience-based method, but future work is necessary to suit it, like any other ML algorithm, to the hospitals' needs.","Machine learning; Surgical time prediction; Linear regression; Support vector machine; Regression trees; Assembly methods","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper aims to provide hospital decision makers with easy-to-follow guidelines for the daily patient scheduling decisions and presents a novel chance-constraint optimisation model to develop efficient admission templates for elective surgeries on a tactical level. With a given patient mix, we decide on the number of surgeries that can realistically be treated during a typical week, with respect to limited resources of OR and ICU and considering stochastic demand. The benefit of such templates is exemplified using a dedicated simulation model in a realistic case study. The simulation model rebuilds daily operations in OR and ICU and allows to mimic typical decision making in OR and ICU. Computational studies show that continually applying such templates as admission guidelines leads to a well-utilised OR and efficiently used ICUs. The extensive simulation studies confirm that the template plans obtained from the chance-constraint optimisation model can provide guidance for an operating room planner.","OR in health services; Operating room; Intensive care unit; Chance-constraint optimisation model; Discrete-event simulation","","","","","","","","","","",""

The solution is tested on benchmarks with realistic sizes and parameters, on three scenarios for the target length on 5-day scheduling, common in small--medium-sized hospitals, and results show that ASP is a suitable solving methodology for the ORS problem in such setting. Then, we also performed a scalability analysis on the schedule length up to 15 days, which still shows the suitability of our solution also on longer plan horizons. Moreover, we also present an ASP solution for the rescheduling problem, that is, when the offline schedule cannot be completed for some reason.

Existing studies usually consider OR scheduling problems by ignoring the influence of uncertainties in surgery durations on the OR assignment. In this paper, we address this issue by formulating accurate patient waiting times as the cumulative sum of uncertain surgery durations from the robust discrete approach point of view. Specifically, by considering the patients’ uncertain surgery duration, we formulate the robust OR scheduling model to minimize the sum of the fixed OR opening cost, the patient waiting penalty cost, and the OR overtime cost. Then, we adopt the box uncertainty set to specify the uncertain surgery duration, and a robustness coefficient is introduced to control the robustness of the model. This resulting robust model is essentially intractable in its original form because there are uncertain variables in both the objective function and constraint. To make this model solvable, we then transform it into a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model by employing the robust discrete optimization theory and the strong dual theory. Moreover, to evaluate the reliability of the robust OR scheduling model under different robustness coefficients, we theoretically analyze the constraint violation probability associated with overtime constraints. Finally, an in-depth numerical analysis is conducted to verify the proposed model’s effectiveness and to evaluate the robustness coefficient’s impact on the model performance. Our analytical results indicate the following: (1) With the robustness coefficient, we obtain the tradeoff relationship between the total management cost and the constraint violation probability, i.e., a smaller robustness coefficient yields remarkably lower total management cost at the expense of a noticeably higher constraint violation probability and vice versa. (2) The obtained total management cost is sensitive to small robustness coefficient values, but it hardly changes as the robustness coefficient increases to a specific value. (3) The obtained total management cost becomes increasingly sensitive to the perturbation factor with the decrease in constraint violation probability.","OR scheduling model; uncertainsurgery duration; constraint violation probability; patients'waiting time; total OR management cost","","","","","","","","","","",""

In these nonstationary situations the search algorithm has to be designed so that it can compensate for the unpredictable environment by monitoring its performance and altering some aspects of its behaviour.

This means that not all possible combinations of variable values represent valid solutions to the problem at hand, and we examine how this impacts on the design of an evolutionary algorithm. This issue has great practical relevance because many real-world problems are constrained. It is also theoretically challenging, since many intractable problems (NP-hard, NP-complete, etc.) are constrained. Unfortunately, constraint handling is not straightforward in an EA, because the variation operators (mutation and recombination) are typically `blind'to constraints. This means that even if the parents satisfy some constraints, there is no guarantee their offspring will. This chapter reviews the most commonly used techniques for constraint handling, identifies a number of common features, and provides some guidance for the algorithm designer.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of course, the world around us is full of examples of human intervention in biological evolution, in the form of pets, garden flowers, food crops and farm animals. Applications of Interactive Evolutionary Algorithms (IEAs) range from capturing aesthetics in art and design, to the personalisation of artefacts such as medical devices. When including humans `in the loop'we must consider their peculiar characteristics. On one hand, they can provide insight and guidance beyond simply selecting parents for breeding. On the other, they can be inconsistent, and are prone to fatigue and loss of attention. These factors make it inappropriate to use the `traditional'model of an EA generating possibly thousands of candidate solutions. This chapter describes and explains some of the major algorithmic changes that have been proposed to cope with these issues.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evaluating a solution may involve an element of random noise, but does not particularly depend on the context in which it is done. However, there are two obvious scenarios in which this set-up does not really hold. The first occurs when a solution represents some strategy or design that works in opposition to some competitor that is itself adapting. The most obvious example here would be adversarial game-playing such as chess. The second comes about when a solution being evolved does not represent a complete solution to a problem, but instead can only be evaluated as part of a greater whole, that together accomplishes some task. An example might be the evolution of a set of traffic-light controllers, each to be sited on a different junction, with fitness reflecting their joint performance in reducing congestion over a day's simulated traffic. Both of these are examples of coevolution. This chapter gives an overview of the types of scenarios where coevolution might be usefully applied, and of some of the issues involved in designing a successful application.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, (at least in the authors'opinions) this is unlikely ever to be realised, and most researchers will currently happily settle for techniques that provide any verifiable insights into EA behaviour, even on simple test problems. The reason for what might seem like limited ambition lies in one simple fact: evolutionary algorithms are hugely complex systems, involving many random factors. Moreover, while the field of EAs is fairly young, it is worth noting that the field of population genetics and evolutionary theory has a head start of more than a hundred years, and is still battling against the barrier of complexity.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of this paper is to obtain a nearly optimal schedule in reasonable computational time. The term ``optimal''is defined as the lowest surgically related cost while achieving the given threshold with respect to some specific deterministic or stochastic performance measures. The optimization model involves expected and probabilistic formulations that are analytically intractable. This implies that traditional mathematical programming techniques cannot be used directly. Therefore, we propose adapted rapid-screening and stochastic-approximation algorithms to deal with the first-stage and the second-stage problems, respectively.

Stochastic programming models were formulated and solved to tackle the stochasticity in the procedure durations and patient arrival patterns. The first model, a two-stage stochastic programming model, is formulated to optimize the slot size. The second model further optimizes the inpatient block (IPB) placement and slot size simultaneously. A computational method is developed to solve the second optimization problem. A case study is conducted using the data from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) centers of Lahey Hospital and Medical Center (LHMC). The current schedule and the schedules obtained from the optimization models are evaluated and compared using simulation based on FlexSim Healthcare. Results indicate that the overall weighted cost can be reduced by 11.6% by optimizing the slot size and can be further reduced by an additional 12.6% by optimizing slot size and IPB placement simultaneously. Three commonly used sequencing rules (IPBEG, OPBEG, and a variant of ALTER rule) were also evaluated. The results showed that when optimization tools are not available, ALTER variant which evenly distributes the IPBs across the day has the best performance. Sensitivity analysis of weights for patient waiting time, machine idle time and exam cancellations further supports the superiority of ALTER variant sequencing rules compared to the other sequencing methods. A Pareto frontier was also developed and presented between patient waiting time and machine idle time to enable medical centers with different priorities to obtain solutions that accurately reflect their respective optimal tradeoffs. An extended optimization model was also developed to incorporate the emergency patient arrivals. The optimal schedules from the extended model show only minor differences compared to those from the original model, thus proving the robustness of the scheduling solutions obtained from our optimal models against the impacts of emergency patient arrivals.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The operating room department is typically one of the most costly units in a hospital. Hospital managers are always interested in finding effective ways of using operating rooms to minimize operating costs. In this research, we study the operating room scheduling problem. We consider the use of a weekly surgery schedule with an open scheduling strategy that takes into account the availabilities of surgeons and operating rooms. The objective is to minimize the total operating cost while maximizing the utilization of the operating rooms but also minimizing overtime use. A revised mathematical model is proposed that can provide optimal solutions for a surgery size up to 110 surgical cases. Next, two modified heuristics, based on the earliest due date (EDD) and longest processing time (LPT) rules, are proposed to quickly find feasible solutions to the studied problem. Finally, an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm that incorporates the initial solutions, a recovery scheme, local search schemes, and an elitism strategy is proposed. The computational results show that, for a surgery size between 40 and 100 surgical cases, the ABC algorithm found optimal solutions to all of the tested problems. For surgery sizes larger than 110 surgical cases, the ABC algorithm performed significantly better than the two proposed heuristics. The computational results indicate that the proposed ABC is promising and capable of solving large problems.","scheduling; operating rooms; artificial bee colony; heuristic","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the day surgery service process of large public hospitals in China, we found that the service efficiency of the process depends on the utilization of hospital resources efficiently and could be optimized through day surgery scheduling. We described it as a flexible flow shop owing to the three-station nature of surgery. Allocating all types of hospital resources to the three stations and determining the length of time for each stage during surgery are crucial to improving the efficiency of DSC. This paper integrates a three-station job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) into the day surgery scheduling and optimization problem. The JSSP was formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model, and the elicitation of the model for scheduling surgeries with different priorities in the DSC is discussed. The model illustrated a case study of the DSC within West China Hospital (WCH). Numerical experiments based on the genetic algorithm design were conducted. Compared to the other optimization strategies, we proposed that the three-station job shop scheduling strategy (TSJS) could not only improve the efficiency and reduce the waiting time of the patients of the DSC in large public hospitals in China but also allow for timely scheduling adjustments during the advent of emergency surgeries.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The complicated connection and interplay between ORs and their upstream and downstream units has recently attracted research attention to focus more on allocating medical resources efficiently for the sake of a balanced coordination. As a critical step, surgical scheduling in the presence of uncertain surgery durations is pivotal but rather challenging since a patient cannot be hospitalized if a recovery bed will not be available to accommodate the admission. To tackle the challenge, we propose an overflow strategy that allows patients to be assigned to an undesignated department if the designated one is full. It has been proved that overflow strategy can successfully alleviate the imbalance of capacity utilization. However, some studies indicate that implementation of the overflow strategy exacerbates the readmission rate as well as the length of stay (LOS). To rigorously examine the overflow strategy and explore its optimal solution, we propose a Fuzzy model for surgical scheduling by explicitly considering downstream shortage, as well as the uncertainty of surgery duration and patient LOS. To solve the Fuzzy model, a hybrid algorithm (so-called GA-P) is developed, stemming from Genetic Algorithm (GA). Extensive numerical results demonstrate the plausible efficiency of the GA-P algorithm, especially for large-scale scheduling problems (e.g., comprehensive hospitals). Additionally, it is shown that the overflow cost plays a critical role in determining the efficiency of the overflow strategy; viz., benefits from the overflow strategy can be reduced as the overflow cost increases, and eventually almost vanishes when the cost becomes sufficiently large. Finally, the Fuzzy model is tested to be effective in terms of simplicity and reliability, yet without cannibalizing the patient admission rate.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the extensive fixed cost of medical facilities and the high specialization required by the medical staff, the problem of resource scarcity in a health care supply chain is much more acute than in other industries. In the pandemic of the Coronavirus, where medical services are the most important services in communities, and protective and preventive guidelines impose new restrictions on the system, the issue of resource allocation will be more complicated and significantly affect the efficiency of health care systems. In this paper, the problem of activating the operating rooms in hospitals, assigning active operating rooms to the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, assigning specialty teams to the operating rooms and assigning the elective and emergency patients to the specialty teams, and scheduling their operations is studied by considering the new constraints of protective and preventive guidelines of the Coronavirus. To address these issues, a mixed-integer mathematical programming model is proposed. Moreover, to consider the uncertainty in the surgery duration of elective and emergency patients, the stochastic robust optimization approach is utilized. The proposed model is applied for the planning of operating rooms in the cardiovascular department of a hospital in Iran, and the results highlight the role of proper management in supplying sufficient medical resources effectively to respond to patients and scheduled surgical team to overcome the pressure on hospital resources and medical staff results from pandemic conditions.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A mathematical programming model is presented to solve the problem. Because the problem is strongly NP-hard, two heuristic algorithms are presented. A heuristic algorithm based on a mathematical programming model with local search obtains near-optimal solutions for all the samples. The average relative deviation of this algorithm is 0.02%. In continuous, heuristic algorithms performance have been investigated by increasing the number of patients and reduce the number of recovery beds.

Multiple factors contribute to OR delays and impact patient safety, patient satisfaction scores, and hospital financial performance. Reducing OR delays allows better utilization of OR resources and staffing and improves patient satisfaction while decreasing operating costs. Accurate scheduling can be the basis to achieve these goals. The objective of this initial study was to identify factors not normally documented in the electronic health record (EHR) that may contribute to or be indicators of OR delays. Materials and Methods. A retrospective data analysis was performed analyzing 67,812 OR cases from 12 surgical specialties at a small university medical center from 2010 through the first quarter of 2017. Data from the hospital’s EHR were exported and subjected to statistical analysis using Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Results. Statistical analysis of the extracted EHR data revealed factors that were associated with OR delays including, surgical specialty, preoperative assessment testing, patient body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification, daily procedure count, and calendar year. Conclusions. Delays hurt OR efficiency on many levels. Identifying those factors may reduce delays and better accommodate the needs of surgeons, staff, and patients thereby leading to improved patient’s outcomes and patient satisfaction. Reducing delays can decrease operating costs and improve the financial position of the operating theater as well as that of the hospital. Anesthesiology teams can play a key role in identifying factors that cause delays and implementing mitigating efficiencies.","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At this early stage of an epidemic, where no vaccine or medical treatment is in sight, algorithmic prediction can become a powerful tool to inform local policymaking. However, when we replicated one prominent epidemiological model to inform health authorities in a region in the south of Brazil, we found that this model relied too heavily on manually predetermined covariates and was too reactive to changes in data trends. Our four proposed models access data of both daily reported deaths and infections as well as take into account missing data (e.g., the under-reporting of cases) more explicitly, with two of the proposed versions also attempting to model the delay in test reporting. We simulated weekly forecasting of deaths from the period from 31/05/2020 until 31/01/2021, with first week data being used as a cold-start to the algorithm, after which we use a lighter variant of the model for faster forecasting. Because our models are significantly more proactive in identifying trend changes, this has improved forecasting, especially in long-range predictions and after the peak of an infection wave, as they were quicker to adapt to scenarios after these peaks in reported deaths. Assuming reported cases were under-reported greatly benefited the model in its stability, and modelling retroactively-added data (due to the ``hot''nature of the data used) had a negligible impact on performance.","Predictive analytics; Bayesian model; Epidemic forecasting; Infection wave; COVID-19","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we examined nationwide temporal trends and between-hospital variation in in-hospital mortality, 30-day readmissions and length-of-stay above the All-Patient-Refined Diagnoses-Related-Group (APR-DRG)-specific 90th percentile (pLOS). We modelled 13,660,187 admissions derived from an administrative database occurring between 2008 and 2018 in 90 (89%) Belgian acute-care hospitals. We applied an APR-DRG-specific logistic regression to study temporal trends in outcomes, hospital-level associations between outcomes, associations of outcomes with hospitals characteristics, and to evaluate how many and which APR-DRGs explained between-hospital variation. Our proposed analytical model managed to achieve novel insights into healthcare quality of care, illustrating the high potential administrative databases can provide. It was revealed that between-hospital variation in outcomes is likely due to systemic hospital factors. This is illustrated by the fact that baseline bottom-performing hospitals remained underperforming throughout the study period and vice versa. APR-DRG-specific between-hospital variation assessments further confirmed this. When hospitals have overall outcome ratios that significantly deviate from the benchmark, this seems to be driven by a considerable number of APR-DRGs, comprising a diverse set of pathologies. This urges a healthcare policy reform wherein longitudinal follow-up and benchmarking of patient outcomes should become the starting point towards targeted quality improvement interventions.","Temporal trends; Logistic regression; Hospital; Mortality; Length of stay; Readmissions","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study proposes a deep learning (DL) framework to automatically extract features from structured and unstructured Electronic Health Records (EHR) data of ED visits and predict patients who are likely to bounce-back. Data from 120,000+ visits to the ED of four major hospitals in New York city over 4+ years are used to validate the proposed framework. The DL model was able to predict 74.8% of the bounce-backs (AUROC= 0.766). Notably, our results show that leveraging state-of-the-art DL techniques to extract features from unstructured ED physician narrative notes and incorporating them (along with structured vitals and demographics data) in the prediction task can remarkably improve the outcome. In addition, a sensitivity analysis performed on the structured features of the model revealed that factors such as patients'age, type of medical insurance, chronic conditions (especially renal, heart, and respiratory), heart failure, and head or neck trauma are among the top factors increasing the chances of patients'unplanned return to the ED. The proposed framework may be used as a decision support tool to assist emergency care clinicians in the early identification of the high-risk patients who are likely to bounce-back and provide them with timely, appropriate care.","Eergency department; Deep learning; Bounce-back; Predictive analytics; Healthcare","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using discrete-event simulation of patient care paths in hospitals, synthetic data that eliminates issues of confounding affects from the simultaneous occurrence of regional response actions and/or changes in resources, treatments or other situational circumstances, is produced for estimating hospital capacity for pandemic response. Results from systematically designed numerical experiments produced several findings. These include that the higher the acceleration in pandemic patient demand growth, the greater the impact of the intervention. Cutting this acceleration by 75% from the greatest studied rate created over four additional weeks to prepare for an 80% risk of running out of intensive care beds. Additionally, the greater the acceleration in growth, the fewer the days with a high risk of running out of beds, but the greater the total number of critical patients that could not be served with existing resources. Finally, the lower this acceleration, the fewer resources or modifications needed to cope with the surge, but the longer they are needed. The findings further show how hospitals can benefit from analytical tools that exploit digital health information to predict and plan for need levels and time to onset of these levels. These tools can be embedded within a real-time framework in which automated and early warnings can inform the selection of strategies for managing or coping with expected increases in demand for emergency hospital services.","Discrete-event simulation; COVID-19; Hospital capacity management; Intensive care; Digital health solution; Bed shortage prediction","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study is to offer a mathematical model for locating emergency medical centers with the goal of increasing both the quantity and quality of demand coverage.

Hence, an assessment of the optimal inpatient length of stay (LOS) associated with lower readmission rate is important for healthcare providers.

The primary goal of this study is to highlight the interrelated risk factors of LOS and readmission for cardiac patients. The study also examines the influence of PAC referral on LOS and readmission. In this paper, a cohort of 13,982 Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) and Valve Replacement (VR) patients from 49 hospitals in the U.S. were analyzed with respect to the association of healthcare delivery, demographics, PAC referral, and clinical conditions with LOS and readmission.

Referral to PAC was included as a vital predictor in both models to examine its impact on optimal LOS and improving patient outcomes. The results indicate a non-uniform care distribution across census divisions and an inverse relationship between LOS and readmissions. The analytics showed that higher LOS patients were more often referred to PAC and yet they were more prone to readmission except for the patients who were referred to Long Term Care (LTC). This study identifies the effects of healthcare delivery, demographic, comorbidity, and PAC referral factors on readmission and LOS, so that personalized acute and post-acute care coordination can be achieved to improve overall patient outcomes.

These delays have two important implications: Firstly, delayed patients continue occupying their beds in acute care, blocking new patients from being admitted and incurring additional costs of operating acute beds. Secondly, admission delays could adversely impact rehabilitation outcomes. In this thesis, we propose new empirical and stochastic models of patient flow and use them to develop insights and operational interventions aimed at reducing admission delays. In Chapter 2, we investigate the sources of admission delays in Low Tolerance Long Duration (LTLD) rehabilitation. Admission delays can be caused by capacity constraints or extra processing requirements to plan rehabilitation activities. However, standard data only includes a single (combined) measure of delay, and the bed allocation decisions in practice can be quite complicated with multiple determinant factors. To address these challenges, we propose a Hidden Markov Model to estimate the status-quo bed allocation policy with unobserved processing times. The estimation results are then combined with a high-fidelity queueing model of the system to evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions to reduce admission delays. In Chapter 3, we focus on High Tolerance Short Duration (HTSD) rehabilitation and investigate the causal impact of delays on rehabilitation length-of-stays (LOSs) and outcomes. By utilizing an instrumental variable approach, we find that admission delays increase the rehabilitation LOS and negatively impact the functional outcomes of the patients in rehabilitation. Finally, motivated by the empirical findings of Chapter 3, in Chapter 4, we develop approximately optimal scheduling policies for multiclass queues with wait-dependent service times. We propose a simulation-based approximate policy iteration algorithm, wherein the policy improvement step is guided through Machine Learning-based classifiers and the policy evaluation is accelerated using a coupling approach. Using extensive numerical experiments, we investigate the scalability of the proposed algorithm and further apply it in a Case Study calibrated using HTSD rehabilitation data.","approximate dynamic programming, causal inference, healthcare operations, hidden Markov models, patient flow, structural estimation","","","","Ph.D. Thesis","","","","","","University of Toronto",""

Firstly, a problem-specific initialization strategy based on a four-vector representation is presented, which corresponds to four sub-problems including factory assignment, operation sequence, machine assignment, and speed assignment. Secondly, five different types of evolutionary operators with adaption strategy is designed to guide the bi-population to complete efficient evolution. Thirdly, a knowledge-guided local search strategy is used to enhance the exploitation capability of the algorithm. Furthermore, an elaborately-designed energy-saving strategy based on knowledge is developed to further reduce energy consumption.

A hospital clinic has a queue for patients needing care. After being seen in clinic, many require follow-up surgery, for which they also wait in a queue. The rate-limiting factor is physician availability for both clinic visits and surgical cases. Although much existing work has been done to optimize clinic appointments, as well as to optimize surgical appointments, this novel approach models the entire patient journey at the system level, through both clinic and surgery, to optimize the total patient experience. A discrete-event simulation model of the system was built based on historic patient encounter data and validated. The system model was then optimized to determine the best allocation of physician resources across the system to minimize total patient wait time using machine learning. The results were then compared to baseline.","discrete event simulation; healthcare; systems engineering","","","","","","","","","","",""
